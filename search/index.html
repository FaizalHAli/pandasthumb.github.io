<h1>Searching in posts</h1>
<p>
There is currently no search capability at this site.  But there is a way to do this:
<p>
<strong>Using Google</strong>  If you have keywords, such as "Ark Park" and want to search for
them, but restrict the results to ones at this site, use Google and put into the search field:
<p>
        site:pandasthumb.org Ark Park
<p>
and this will return results only from posts at this site.
<p>
<h1>Finding older comments</h1>
<p>
You may notice that there seem to be no comments before March, 2016 on any post, even those that
are years older than that.  Panda's Thumb started in 2004, using Movable Type blog software.
There were many comments on the posts.
<p>
In 2016 the Movable Type platform had become difficult to use, and it was decided
to port the site to Githuub Pagesm and use Disqus for the comments.  It was difficult
to move the old comments to Disqus, so they were not moved.  This gives the appearance
that no one responded to the posts.
<p>
But there is hope.  The old comments were archived, and we have them.  We need to
go through the process of reformatting them in a form appropriate for Disqus and
putting them into the comments there.  We hope to do so over the coming year.
<p>
<h1>How to see some of the old comments</h1>
<p>
Panda's Thumb is archived at the Wayback Machine of the Internet Archive at
archive.org.  To see this archived material you can go to
<p<
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/201611260821342/http://www.pandasthumb.org/">https://web.archive.org/web/201611260821342/http://www.pandasthumb.org/</a<
<p>
which is a snapshot of the site as of November 11, 2016.  The "Archives" link there will carry
you to lists of posts by month.  There are comments on the posts, but not all of them.  The
comments at Movable Type were organized in pages.  For some unknown reason, the Wayback
Machine does not archive all pages of comments, only the first page and the last page
for each post.  Nvertheless this should give you some idea of the discussion.
<p>
If you want to make a comment on an old post, do it at our present site -- you cannot
add comments to the Wayback Machine archived version.
