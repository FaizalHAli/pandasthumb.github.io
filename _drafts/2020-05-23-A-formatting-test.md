I want now to get to the issues I meant to discuss in this thread. They follow on the discussion between Dan Eastwood and I.  Let me start by making several comments, which I will number to make the sequence clear:  COMMENT #1.  In his 2005 paper on "Specification" (link in the main post, above) Dembski defines Context-Dependent Specified Complexity as -<em>log<sub>2</sub>[M N &phi;<sub>S</sub>(t) P(T|<b>H</b>)]</em>.  A high value of this is said to indicate Design.
