<figcaption><a href="https://wiki.bugwood.org/HPIPM:Platypedia_putnami">Platypedia putnami</a> &ndash; Putnam's cicada. I had no idea we had cicadas in Colorado, till this one decided to spend the night on the glazing inside a coldframe. According to the Colorado State University Extension, <a href="https://extension.colostate.edu/topic-areas/insects/cicadas-5-590/">13- and 17-year cicadas do not occur in Colorado</a>, so perhaps this one only showed up in sympathy.
