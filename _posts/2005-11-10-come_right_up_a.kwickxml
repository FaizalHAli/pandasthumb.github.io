<p>Apparently Pastafarians don't have any rules about idolatry, because over on ebay, a <a href="http://cgi.ebay.ca/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=6011889705">a Handmade Flying Spaghetti Monster Plush Doll</a> has received 36 bids and is currently selling for $242.50.  I don't even know who is running the auction, but evidently all proceeds (which will be matched by the dollmaker's employer) will be donated to <a href="http://www.ncseweb.org">NCSE</a>, which by the way <a href="http://www.natcenscied.org/membership.asp">is something you should consider doing</a> anyway if you <a href="http://www.ncseweb.org/about.asp">support our mission</a>.</p>
