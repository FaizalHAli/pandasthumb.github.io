Now that the <url href="http://www.uncommondescent.com/just-for-fun/a-monkey-with-a-meme-the-creative-vacuity-of-pim-van-meurs/">'powerful'  and accurate meme of the scientific vacuity of intelligent design</url> has played itself out for all to see in the form of Dembski's response that he would need to see step by step, mutation by mutation, pathways before he is willing to accept evolutionary explanations of the flagellum, it is clear that Dembski has elevated the argument from a merely scientific vacuous  to what by most credible accounts amounts to the Gospel of the Flagellum.


<quote>Worse, what if you learn the Discovery Institute’s teaching that bacterial flagella are the Designer’s handiwork, and then learn that these same flagella greatly aid bacteria in causing human diseases, from plague to diarrhea? Diarrhea is no joke. It remains a leading cause of infant mortality in the third world.</quote>

The Gospel

<quote>Making a Gospel Investment

In about three weeks, Trinity will be undertaking a very intense and strategic effort to present the gospel to the University of Oklahoma.  God has given us incredible mission fields here in Norman with our proximity to a campus that welcomes thousands of students, many of whom have either never heard the gospel or have rejected the truth of the scriptures.

In our effort to penetrate the university campus with the gospel, we are bringing Dr. William Dembski to OU on September 16-17.  Dr. Dembski is one of the foremost experts and leaders in the Intelligent Design movement which is challenging the evolutionary and naturalistic worldview that is so hostile to God.  He will preach at Trinity Sunday morning and then make several presentations at OU during the rest of his time in Norman.  His presentations will be open to the public generally but will specifically target students and professors within several science departments at OU.  In case you are wondering, these departments and their teachings are not friends of Christianity.

We are working diligently to prepare for Dr. Dembski’s time in Norman.  Our college students spent the summer reading and studying, on a weekly basis, in order to be able to share and discuss the issues that will arise from the presentations on campus.  We are working with other churches and organ-izations that share our vision for evangelism and truth to help with financial aspects of this project.

Make no mistake about it, our goal for this project is not to win a debate or to simply present an alternative worldview.  Our prayer for this entire effort is for God to open doors so the power of His gospel would be made known to groups of people who need to hear the truth.  The issues of intelligent design and evolution are far greater than simply differing perspectives about science.  The overall issue is one explaining the world in which we live.  Another issue, Naturalism, eliminates God from the equation and thus affects every other part of life.  That makes this issue one of vital gospel importance!

We earnestly need your help.  It is never cheap to make this kind of gospel investment.  We have many expenses such as speaker honorarium and expenses, facility rentals at OU, meals, lodging, promotion, advertising, etc.  The goal that Trinity has set is $5,000.

If we are able to raise approximately $10,000, we would be capable of doing this event well and promoting it so the most people would know about it. Would you pray about giving to this project?  This event has the potential to affect literally thousands with the gospel. What an incredible opportunity!

We also need people to commit to pray faithfully for this event.  Pray for Dr. Dembski, for our college students, for believing professors who will be involved, and for the gospel to be proclaimed with boldness and power!

Being thankful and watchful for what God will do,

Ryan

Ian Musgrave; No Tom, it is not a just-so story, it is the conclusion of a large amount of research and evidence. Note especially the evidence part. We have evidence from the relationships between various parts of the flagella, experimental manipulations that remove parts of the flagellum and natural variations where parts are missing, and the existence of intermediates that Dembski and his ID colleagues claim cannot exist. Importantly, Dembski claims that the evolution of a flagellum is in principle not possible. Professor Klebba and many others have shown several times over that that it is indeed possible in principle to evolve a flagellum, thus completely destroying DembskiÃ¢ÂÂs argument. The fact that we have significant evidence for our models is the icing on the cake. For example, one should examine the archebacterial flagellum. While resembling the eubacterial flagellum, it is composed of completely different proteins (and somewhat fewer proteins too), and is homologous to the functional intermediate, the type IV pilus, which in turn is homologous to the type II secretion system. Two independently derived flagella systems are both based in secretory systems with clear functional intermediates. Exactly the sort of thing ID advocates say we shouldnÃ¢ÂÂt see. The mutations involved are those well known to molecular biologists, gene duplication with subsequent divergence (virtually all of the filament proteins are duplicates of each other), domain swapping and gain of function mutations, there is nothing mysterious or untoward about them. There is nothing wrong with Dr. Dembski talking about biology, however, he should at least make a token effort to under the biology he critiques. For example less than half of the Ã¢ÂÂ50 or so proteinsÃ¢ÂÂ Dembski claims to be indispensable to the flagella are actually indispensable (either bacteria exist without them, or we can remove them via mutation and the bacteria swim just fine), of those, the vast majority are easily assigned to known precursor proteins. In the end, as Professor Klebba says, ID is nothing more than human ignorance, with flashy power point presentations.

With Meyer as director, the CSC has become the “No. 1 project” of the DI, whose yearly budget of some $4 million comes largely from wealthy fundamentalist Christians and Christian foundations.82 These include the Maclellan Foundation, whose director said of its DI donation, “We give for religious purposes. 
This is not about science, and Darwin wasn’t about science. Darwin was about a metaphysical view of the world.” Another DI donor, the Henry P. and Susan C. Crowell Trust, states its mission as “[t]he teaching and active extension of the doctrines of Evangelical Christianity through approved grants to qualified organiza- 
tions,”84 while the Stewardship Foundation, which gave DI more  than $1 million between 1999 and 2003, states that it “provides  resources to Christ-centered organizations that share their faith  in Jesus Christ with people throughout the world.”85
