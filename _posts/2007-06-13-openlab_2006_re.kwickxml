<a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/631016">The OpenLab 2006</a> has been reviewed for Nature by nuclear physicist and PT reader Paul Stevenson: "<a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v447/n7146/full/447779b.html">Blogger's Unite</a>."  (Don't miss the editor's summary as well: "<a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v447/n7146/edsumm/e070614-03.html">Brought to blook</a>").

The review is pretty positive for something that was put together at the last moment using material that wasn't made for print media.

<blockquote>
The entries highlight the great variety of styles that can thrive in the blogosphere. Most of the pieces are a little chattier than the usual book or magazine article, but those chosen are formal enough not to grate on the printed page. Occasionally, the prose is loftier than a typical popular science book. Some even veer too much towards the tone of a research article --- leaving terms like suprachiasmatic nucleus or a zygomaticomaxillary suture unexplained.

The book works well enough as a standalone anthology of science writing, but I share the editor's hope that it will prompt eager print readers hitherto unfamiliar with the vibrant young medium that is science blogging to have a look, and maybe even have a go.
