On EvolutionNews John West has republished his four articles on the Kitzmiller ruling.  Since the original postings by West and others on the DI blog contained many relevant trackbacks to PandasThumb responses, and since the DI seems to, inadvertently, be blocking PandasThumb trackbacks, I have collected links to relevant responses.

If anyone has relevant links to add, please add them to the comment section and I will update the posting. We at Pandasthumb believe in an open discussion of the merrits of science, intelligent design and the Kitzmiller ruling. 

In other words, we support not only in words but also through our actions to "Teach the controversy".
