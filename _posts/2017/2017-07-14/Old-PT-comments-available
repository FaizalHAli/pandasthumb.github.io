As people may know, PT migrated to its current software platform, and in the process the comments on all old threads disappeared.  They were not lost, but cannot be restored without some further work, and that has been slow to happen.

But ... the comments are actually available in The Wayback Machine (at archive.org).  Hooray for them!   For example, the ones for the post by me and Tom English critiquing the work of Dembski, Ewert, and Marks on 29 March 2015 is
here:

and comments on any other thread (before the migration of PT) can be found by going to "archive.org", searching for "Panda's Thumb" and choosing a backup soon after the date of the thread.  I think even the PT "Bathroom Wall".
