In association with the <a href="http://www.santafe.edu/">Santa Fe Institute</a>, <a href="http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~mm/">Melanie Mitchell</a> will teach a free online course called <a href="http://www.santafe.edu/education/schools/sfi-mooc/introduction-complexity/">Introduction to Complexity</a> starting on January 28, 2013. Mitchell has been working in complex systems research for years. Her Ph.D. advisors were Doug Hofstadter of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach">GÃ¶del, Esher, Bach</a> fame and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Henry_Holland">John Holland</a>, a towering figure in the study of complex adaptive systems, which is the title of his <a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/Adaptation_in_natural_and_artificial_sys.html?id=JE5RAAAAMAAJ">influential 1975 book</a>.
According to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=cHE1Zk2Ov18">the intro video</a> and the <a href="http://www.santafe.edu/media/files/sfi_mooc_FAQ.html">course FAQ</a>, it's is aimed at non-specialists:<blockquote>This course is intended for anyone with an interest in complex systems.  For this introductory course, there are no prerequisites, and no science or math background is necessary.  The level will be similar to that of an interdisciplinary undergraduate class, though the topics are broad enough to be of interest to people ranging from high school students to professionals.</blockquote>To register to earn a certificate of completion, <a href="http://www.santafe.edu/mooc/subscribe">go here</a>.
