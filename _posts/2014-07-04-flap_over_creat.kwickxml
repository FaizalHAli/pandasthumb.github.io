was shown as part of an otherwise innocuous <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B4ni2jH9ge1SdjBLcTAwWjdNWW8/edit">PowerPoint presentation</a> to a freshman biology class at Grady High School in Atlanta and <a href="http://www.ajc.com/weblogs/get-schooled/2014/jul/03/evolution-vs-creationism-why-still-issue-grady-or-/">caused a bit of a flap</a>, according to <i>The Atlanta Journal-Constitution</i>. 

The teacher and the district science coordinator apparently refused interviews, but the <a href="http://thesoutherneronline.com/frontpage/?p=29658">student newspaper reports</a>, based on interviews with students, that the teacher did not teach evolution and seemed to favor creationism.
