Nature has a cool <url href="http://www.nature.com/nature/videoarchive/ancientwhale/index.html">mini-documentary</url> which outlines why the researchers believe that indohyus is a missing link. As <url href="http://scienceblogs.com/islandofdoubt/2007/12/where_the_whales_came_from.php?utm_source=sbhomepage&utm_medium=link&utm_content=toplink">James Hrynyshyn</url> points out, there is still much work to be done but it shows real scientists go about developing exciting new hypotheses which lead to more scientific inquiry. Also list to the Nature <url href="http://media.nature.com/download/nature/nature/podcast/v450/n7173/nature-2007-12-20.mp3">podcast</url>  or read the full text at <url href="http://origin.www.nature.com/nature/journal/v450/n7173/full/nature06343.html">Nature</url>. We learn how through hard work and serendipity, the link between Indohyus and the cetaceans was uncovered. While cleaning the fossil which had been found 15 years ago, a researcher accidentally broke off an ear. Before gluing it back on, the researcher showed the ear to Thewissen and his team and they noticed how the inner ear was very whale-like.

You may ask yourself, what has Intelligent Design contributed to our scientific knowledge.
