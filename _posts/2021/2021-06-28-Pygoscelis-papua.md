Today is one of the middle Mondays of the <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2021/06/photography-contest-xiii.html">Photography Contest</a>, and I want to display a photograph sent to us by Jerry Coyne. Professor Coyne is the proprietor of the popular blog, <a href="https://whyevolutionistrue.com/">Why Evolution Is True</a>. He publishes a daily readers' wildlife photo feature, which can include travel or street photography, and he likes to get batches of around ten photos. He requests that any PT readers who have <i>good</i> photographs submit them to j-coyne@uchicago.edu. Professor Coyne is an <a href="https://ecologyandevolution.uchicago.edu/people/emeritus-faculty">Emeritus Professor of Ecology and Evolution</a> at the University of Chicago.

I think he must have considered my photographs to be acceptable, because he graciously posted eight of them the other day. You may see them <a href="https://whyevolutionistrue.com/2021/06/26/readers-wildlife-photos-1336/">here</a>, if you have not already seen some of them on PT.
