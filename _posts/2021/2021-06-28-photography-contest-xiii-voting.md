1000 apologies, but I will be having a bit of <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tsuris"><i>tsuris</i></a> next Thursday, so I plan to cut off voting on Sunday, July 25, at noon, MDT. I will post the winner on Monday, July 26, also at noon, MDT. Voting has slowed considerably in the last day or two; if you want to vote, you have the next 3 days to do so.
