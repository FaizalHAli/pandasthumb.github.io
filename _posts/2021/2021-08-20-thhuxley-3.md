This morning, we received an e-mail, what amounts to a press release, from Professor Steve Hollenhorst of Western Washington University, regarding renaming the Huxley College of the Environment, which we reported on <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2021/08/thhuxley-2.html">here</a>. Professor Hollenhorst's communication follows:

<blockquote>We have submitted to the WWU Board of Trustees our response to the Legacy Review Task Force Report. You can find it <a href="https://huxley.wwu.edu/response-legacy-review-task-force-report">here</a>. <br/><br/>
 
Please feel free to share it at your blogs and elsewhere you feel appropriate. Note that we describe it as a “living document” that will be updated periodically as more contributions are submitted and vetted.<br/><br/>
 
Also, today at 8:50 am PDT, Dr. Wayne Landis and I will be making public comments at the BOT meeting, introducing them to the response document and briefly summarizing it.</blockquote>

You may find documentation for the meeting <a href="https://trustees.wwu.edu/meeting-materials">here</a>. The meeting itself will be audiocast <a href="https://wp.wwu.edu/live/">here</a>.
