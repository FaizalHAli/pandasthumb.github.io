This morning, a group of faculty from Western Washington University submitted  their response to the University's Legacy Review Task Force Report, regarding renaming the Huxley College of the Environment. We reported on the controversy <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2021/08/thhuxley-2.html">here</a>. 

You can find the group's response <a href="https://huxley.wwu.edu/response-legacy-review-task-force-report">here</a>. Note that they describe it as a “living document” that will be updated periodically as more contributions are submitted and vetted. 
 
Today at 8:50 a.m. PDT, two of the coauthors, Steve Hollenhorst and Wayne Landis, made public comments at the Board of Trustees meeting, introducing them to the response document and briefly summarizing it.

You may find documentation for the meeting <a href="https://trustees.wwu.edu/meeting-materials">here</a>. The meeting itself was audiocast <a href="https://wp.wwu.edu/live/">here</a>. We will provide a URL when the archived file is made available.
