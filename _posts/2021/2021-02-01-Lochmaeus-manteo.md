<figcaption><i>Lochmaeus manteo</i> &ndash; <a href="http://bugguide.net/node/view/418">variable oakleaf caterpillar moth larva</a>. Mr. Denelsbeck writes, "I was doing closeup images of the head of what was possibly a variable oakleaf caterpillar moth larva, when the flash brought up something curious. Apparently, between the translucent exoskeleton and the light angle, I got a glimpse of the internal anatomy of the caterpillar, but whether that is the actual brain or not I cannot say. I just liked the comic-book nuclear effect. The caterpillar measured 25&nbsp;mm overall, with the head being just 2.5&nbsp;mm in width." I stared at Mr. Denelsbeck's photo for a long time, incidentally, before I realized that the body is in the upper left, and the mouthparts, I think, in the lower right. If that is wrong, take me to task in the Comments.
