<figcaption><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_pseudacorus"><i>Iris pseudacorus</i></a> &ndash; yellow flag iris, Cottonwood Lake, Boulder, Colorado, June, 2015. This plant is an aquatic iris. I took this snapshot in 2015 (and an earlier one in 2009) and did not give it much thought. The plant was not very widespread when I snapped the pictures, but last week I came across a sign warning that the area had been sprayed to control yellow flag iris, cattail, and teasel. Sure enough, the Colorado Department of Agriculture <a href="https://ag.colorado.gov/conservation/noxious-weeds/noxious-weed-species-id/yellow-flag-iris">considers yellow flag iris a noxious weed</a>, though it is only on a watchlist and not regulated. I have no idea why cattail is being sprayed, but <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2013/02/dipsacus-fullon.html">teasel</a> is very invasive.
