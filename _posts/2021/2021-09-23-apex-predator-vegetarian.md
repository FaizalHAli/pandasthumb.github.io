<i>Guest post by <strong>Dan Phelps</strong>, to whom we are indebted for unearthing this whopper from Answers in Genesis:</i><br/>

Once again, creationists are misrepresenting a recent dinosaur discovery. This time it is a large carcharodontosaur from Uzbekistan that was recently described in a paper, <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.210923">A new carcharodontosaurian theropod dinosaur occupies apex predator niche in the early Late Cretaceous of Uzbekistan</a>, by Kohei Tanaka and colleagues from the universities of Tsukuba, Hokkaido, and Calgary.<br/>

On today’s “Answers News,” an online news video by Answers in Genesis, their employees (including Ken Ham’s son-in-law, Bodie Hodge) discuss this dinosaur. The discussion can be found from about 9 minutes, 30 seconds to about 14 minutes in <a href="https://youtu.be/4Jhf2eKXwAc">this</a> YouTube video.  As is par for the course, they ignore the actual publication and rely instead on popular press discussions such as <a href="https://www.deseret.com/u-s-world/2021/9/9/22664700/tyrannosaurus-rex-ulughbegsaurus-uzbekistanensis-bigger-dinosaur">this one</a> . They also add their bizarre creationist interpretations and claim the fossil was buried in Noah’s Flood. <br/>

Even more ridiculously, they suggest the theropod dinosaur &ndash; the apex predator! &ndash; may have been a vegetarian. This would be amusing except that AIG is misinforming children and adults via such broadcasts as above, the Creation “Museum,” and their Kentucky-taxpayer&ndash;subsidized “Ark Encounter.”
