I was looking at a post today at Uncommon Descent, wondering what strange interpretation they were going to make of this palaeoanthropology report from 
Smithsonian Magazine.
On my browser, in the middle of the post there was an ad.  I know that the UD site is not responsible for which ad gets put onto the page when I view it.  In this case a bot seems
to be responding to the word "footprint".

<p>
The advertising bot appears to have decided that <em>Graecopithecus</em> needed relief for sore feet.  It does not realize that 6 million years ago hominids did not have 
Amazon accounts.
