<figcaption>Pair of red foxes, <a href="https://cpw.state.co.us/fox">Vulpes vulpes</a>, um, enjoying the outdoors. The Boulder <i>Daily Camera</i> on December 21 called it a Festive Frolic. I had to take the picture through a dirty glass window to avoid disturbing them, and I confess to a little image processing.
