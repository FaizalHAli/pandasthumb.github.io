Yesterday, March 14, was Pi Day, and I learned today that several representatives introduced a <a href="https://www.congress.gov/117/bills/hres221/BILLS-117hres221ih.pdf">RESOLUTION Expressing support for designation of March 14, 2021, as &ldquo;National Pi Day&rdquo;</a>. I thought it was a good resolution, and it concluded,

<blockquote>Whereas Pi can be approximated as 3.14, and thus March 14, 2021, is an appropriate day for "National Pi Day": Now, therefore, be it <br/><br/>

<i>Resolved</i>, That the House of Representatives— <br/>

(1) supports the designation of a "Pi Day" and its celebration around the world; <br/>

(2) recognizes the continuing importance of the National Science Foundation’s math and science education programs; <br/>

and (3) encourages schools and educators to observe the day with appropriate activities that teach students about Pi and engage them about the study of mathematics.</blockquote>

The bill was <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/221/all-info">introduced on March 11</a>, which gave them 3 days to pass it. Guess where the bill is now….
