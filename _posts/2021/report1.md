It is rather easy to find examples of misconceptions about evolution and misinterpretations of scientific results. All you need to do is look at the latest articles at the Discovery Institute's site "Evolution News &amp; Science Today".  Case in point: their take on a recent paper by Stilianos Louca and Matt Pennell in <em>Nature</em> last spring.  The paper is
this one:

Louca, S. and Pennell, MW. (2020). Extant timetrees are consistent with a myriad of diversification histories. <em>Nature</em>  
<a href="https://doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2176-1">doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2176-1</a>

It ius behind a paywall, but the preprint version of the paper is
freely available at the Biorxiv preprint server here:

<a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/719435v2.full">
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/719435v2.full</a>

The Discovery Institute's site is quite excited about this paper.  Their
report on 21 January (<a href="https://evolutionnews.org/2021/01/controversy-arising-timetrees-unconstrained/">here</a>) announced that the paper announced something very dramatic:

<blockquote> Two theorists have caused a stir in evolutionary circles, claiming to have proven that Darwinian phylogeny efforts (tree-building) cannot be constrained to one “best” answer. In fact, any proposed tree is no better than an infinity of other trees. They can’t see the tree for the forest.  </blockquote>

Now if true, this would call phylogenies (evolutionary trees) seriously
into question.  Can it be that Louca and Pennell have undermined the
foundation of reconstruction of evolutionary trees?  Or is it possible
instead that the folks at EN&&amp;ST have misread Louca and Pennell's paper?

Guess which is more likely ...

(no points for guessing from the title of this post that the EN&amp;ST people are wrong)

<strong>What the paper's authors assert</strong>

Reading the Conlusions of the Louca and Pennell paper, we immediately see that
<blockquote>
We have shown that for virtually any candidate birth-death process, suspected of having generated some extant timetree, there exists an infinite number of alternative and markedly dierent birth-death processes that could have generated the timetree with the same likelihood. Without further information or prior constraints on plausible diversification scenarios, extant timetrees alone cannot be used to reliably infer speciation rates (except at present-day), extinction rates or net diversification rates, raising serious doubts over a multitude of previous estimates of past diversification dynamics.
</blockquote>

In other words, the authors have a timetree, a tree for a set of species, with the
branching events on a time scale.  The assumption is that the tree is correct. and is
being used to try to estimate what are rates of speciation ("birth" rates of lineages) and extinction ("death rates" of lineages). These rates are the ~diversification
scenario".  Louca and Pennell argue that any one true tree is compatible with many different birth-death processes, and does not distinguish between them.

This is a somewhat shocking result, as it does call into question are ability to
use the tree to infer the birth and death rates of lineages.

<strong>What the Discovery Institute thought the paper meant</strong>

Reading the coverage in Evolution News and Science Today, you'd get a very different impression: the paper is supposed to show that we cannot tell the difference between
phylogenies from the usual biological data used to infer them.  The paper does not
at all say that -- it says that the inferences that can be drawn from an entirely-correct tree do not specify the underlying speciation and extinction rates as narrowly as
previoisly thought.

EN&amp;ST quotes the University of Oregon press release about the paper.  It does get
the issue wrong, talking about "flawa in how scientists build trees of life" and how there are limits on how scientists can "reconstruct evolution's path".  But the "path"
referred to is not the timetree itself, but the combinations fo birth and death rates os species that are compatibile with the correct tree.

<strong> Uncommon Descent chimes in </strong>

The website Uncommon Descent, which is a cheering section for the Discovery Institute, cheered the DI's interpretation.  The post is signed by their commentator News, which is Denyse O'Leary.  She is paid to generate posts for discussion there.  She has some recurrent themes:
<ul>
<li> Science is mostly wrong, as demonstrated by publication scandals, failures the of
peer review process, failure to replicate initial results, and scientists funduing unexpected results. and
<li> Scientific results, are correct when they show that "Darwinism" is wrong.
</ul>

Even though UD lately has been spending time on arguing that the U.S, elections are
rigged, that Quantum Mechanics and Relativity validate the Shroud of Turin. that
consciousness cannot be explained by evolution, that Mathemstics proves the existence of God, etc,.hey did take time out to
cheer "News" when she said that "Darwinian timetrees don't really work", and that they are "deeply flawed".  

Some commenters in the ensuing discussion argued that this conclusion was not warranted, that the timetrees were in fact being taken as completely correct, and questions
only raised about what could be known from rthem about birth-death rates.
