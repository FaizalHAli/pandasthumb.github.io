Yes, this is the same image as in Mikkel Rasmussen's post in June.   And it's appropriate because I want to discuss the same paper in some more detail.  The paper (as you can see) is this one:  HÃ¶ssjer O., G. Bechly and A. Gauger. 2021. On the waiting time until coordinated mutations get fixed in regulatory sequences. *Journal of Theoretical Biology*  **524:** 110657. doi:10.1016/j.jtbi.2021.110657    It is by three affiliates of the Discovery Institute, and was published in a respected journal (at least, one in which I myself have published twice).  The first author is Professor of Mathematical Statistics at the University of Stockholm, Sweden, and has published highly technical papers in theoretical population genetics.
This paper has some serious technical theoretical population genetics, but the model it analyzes is very simple. There is a stretch of DNA (say 50 bases long).  Neutral mutations are occurring at these sites.  When all of them are exactly in a particular target sequence, say the particular 50-base sequence CAGTTAGGGTCA...(and so on)...GGACACT, the stretch of DNA will then function as a regulatory sequence.  Until then, the sites are not under selection, as only that target sequence functions.  The question addressed is how long it will take for neutral evolution to find the target sequence.  There is no selection pushing the sequence towards the target.
