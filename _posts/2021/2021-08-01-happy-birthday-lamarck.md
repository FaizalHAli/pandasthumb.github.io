It has been customary for me to write a post every 1st of August celebrating
the anniversary of the scientist who was, as far as I can see, the first
evolutionary biologist.  No, not Charles Darwin, but Jean-Baptiste Pierre 
Antoine de Monet, the Chevalier de Lamarck.  Born in 1744 to an impoverished
branch of the French nobility, he wrote books on botany, coming to the
attention of the Comte de Buffon, who employed him in the royal botanical
garden in Paris.  After Buffon's death and the French Revolution, he was
appointed to the least important curatorship in the new Museum of Natural
History, as curator of "worms", i.e., invertebrates.

Although originally a botanist, he became fascinated by the structure of
invertebrates,
and from 1801 on he argued that they had evolved in a treelike genealogy. His
theory was propounded in his 1809 book "Philosophie zoologique".  Although
it never convinced most zoologists, it
influenced many thinkers in the early 1800s, including Charles Darwin.

Lamarck was not a crackpot but an important pioneer of invertebrate
biology (he coined the words "invertebrate" and "biology"). He also
put forward the first proposal for a mechanism explaining adaptation. No,
not natural selection, but use and disuse.  This is widely misunderstood,
In what follows I want to briefly explain how it is that people who
think of themselves as Lamarckians get it wrong.

Lamarck had two processes.  One was a rather mysterious inherent
complexifying force, which he thought was a basic physical principle
of some sort.  It does not really explain why a species getting more complex
would also be adaptive.  And of course even by as soon as 100 years later, when
physics and chemistry were much better understood, no one thought that
there was any such principle.  So the Lamarckians of the late 1800s
quietly forgot about that part of Lamarck's theory.

The other process was use and disuse. Organisms used their various
organs, such as eyes, limbs, leaves, etc. to try to cope with their
environments, and these strivings were inherited by their offspring
in ways that resulted in those organs growing a bit in ways that increased
adaptation.  As I explain here every year, everyone in Lamarck's day
thought that there were such inherited effects.  Lamarck did not
invent inheritance of acquired characters, because it was already
widely accepted.  

And here is where modern Lamarckians go badly wrong.  They think that
it is enough to show that an environmental effect is inherited, such
as by epigenetic mechanisms.  And they think that this vindicates
Lamarck.  But to Lamarck it was the organism's strivings to cope with
its surroundings that brought about the inherited effect.  That was what
brought about the directionality of the change, in the direction of
adaptation.  A fish tried to swim, and as it used its fins they grew
larger and stronger in its descendants.

Just showing an environmental effect would not give this directionality.
If your grandfather experienced a famine, and epigenetic inheritance
resulted in some effect on you, why should we think that these would
make you more resistant to famine?  Rather than, say, increasing your
susceptibility to cancer or heart disease?

Modern Lamarckians have not only thrown out Lamarck's inherent complexifying
force, they misunderstand him as merely invoking inheritance of environmental
effects.  By doing that they also abandon any attempt to explain
why change is biased toward adaptation.  Lamarck would not recognize
their theory.  His was wrong, but it at least addressed the big issue,
Modern Lamarckians don't even try to do that.
