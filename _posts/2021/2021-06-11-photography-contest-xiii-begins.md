Announcing the nth Panda's Thumb Photography Contest, where n&nbsp;=&nbsp;13. The contest will begin on Monday, June 21, 12:00, noon, Mountain Daylight Time (MDT&nbsp;=&nbsp;UTC&nbsp;-&nbsp;6). The rules will be the same as <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2020/06/photography-contest-xii.html">last year's</a>, give or take a few modifications. We will accept entries till Wednesday, July 7, also at 12:00 MDT. As in the past, we will post finalists on Monday, July 12, at 12:00. Voting will remain open till Friday, July 23, at 12:00. And we will post the winner on July 26 at 12:00.

We will not establish formal categories, but we reckon that a lot of our readers may have <a href="https://www.dpreview.com/forums/post/64689925">taken up macro photography as a result of the pandemic</a>. Consequently, if we receive enough macro photographs, we may decide to establish two categories, "macro" and " general."

We will announce prizes on June 21.
