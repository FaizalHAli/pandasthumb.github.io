<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarracenia"> <i>Sarracenia</i> sp. </a> â€“ pitcher plant, Green Swamp, west of Wilmington, N. C. (not the Green Swamp west of Orlando).  The photographer writes, "This is a Nature Conservancy site which is typical nitrogen-poor lowland where plants that can find their own protein are favored.  There are also Venus flytraps in the near vicinity and, reportedly, sundews.  Recommended as an easily accessible example of this type of environment."
