[Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve](https://www.nps.gov/grsa/learn/nature/index.htm).  Mr. Long writes, "Dunes up to 200&nbsp;m are formed where wind sweeping across the cold semi-desert of southern Coloradoâ€™s San Luis Valley is funneled toward Mosca Pass in the Sangre de Cristo range on the eastern edge of the southern Rocky Mountains.  The valley itself is a deep graben toward the upper end of the Rio Grande Rift with no surface drainage in its northern reaches."
