At 3 pm on Thursday, December 9, 2021, the Western Washington University Board of Directors is having a final hearing on the proposed de-naming of the Huxley College of the Environment. In a late twist, the Board has apparently abandoned its earlier Legacy Review Task Force Report on Huxley, presumably after all of the historical mistake and distortions were pointed out. Instead, it commissioned a last-minute "Ad Hoc Committee Report", which retreats on most of the anti-Huxley claims, and semi-acknowledges Huxley's numerous progressive achievements, but in the end still recommends de-naming Huxley because, it judges, student perceptions trump context and truth. 

This all matters, because the WWU fight is pretty clearly an initial skirmish in a debate that will continue with the proposed denaming of the Huxley Building at Imperial College London, and other Huxley awards, lectures, and Darwiniana.  Win or lose at WWU, it is important to develop and publicize the evidence and arguments against this kind of thing. What is at stake? Huxley, Darwin, and a great number of other progressive reformers who helped enlighten our society, and, frankly, who helped to develop our modern anti-racist views, will be wiped from the public sphere.

Text (5 minutes to read):

Thank you for giving me an opportunity to speak. My name is Nick Matzke, I am a Senior Lecturer in Biology at the University of Auckland, but until recently my whole career was in the USA. I am interested in society's treatment of Thomas Henry Huxley because I have worked in the fields of science education and evolutionary science for almost 20 years. Part of that work involved the 2005 Kitzmiller v. Dover trial, where I discovered the creationist ancestry of the so-called “intelligent design” movement, promoted by the Discovery Institute of Seattle.

Huxley is an inspiration for me as the original public advocate for science, science education, and science-informed liberalism.

In my science-education work, I have seen first-hand the damage that can be done when ideology trumps careful scholarship. Misinformation spreads, trust in science declines, particularly in vulnerable communities - as we have seen with vaccine hesitancy, for instance. 

In Western’s case, we have the bizarre situation where the discussion of Huxley was dominated for over a year by social justice activists relying on anti-Huxley propaganda found on right-wing creationist and conspiracist websites, including a Discovery Institute author. Thankfully, this has finally been tacitly admitted, with the last-minute "Ad Hoc" committee report excising nearly all of the claims now proven false about Huxley being a polygenist, scientific racist, social Darwinist, eugenicist, etc. Nevertheless, this new Report still recommend the de-naming of Huxley, based on nothing but the premise that student perceptions of Huxley trump the actual facts and context of Huxley's record.

The fact is that Huxley was not just a scientist, a progressive, an advocate for diversity and inclusion in science and science education. He was also, in the main, an anti-racist, a radical, someone who pushed his culture to be better. Due diligence has not been done until the Board accepts a report that includes Huxley's complete record on race. This absolutely must include Huxley's long battle with the scientific racist James Hunt and his Anthropological Society; and Huxley's membership on the Jamaica Committee.

If "James Hunt" and the "Jamaica Committee" are not familiar to you, that may be because no pro-denaming document issued by Western has yet succeeded in even discussing them! Here is a brief summary:

In October 1865, just after the end of the US Civil War, hundreds of Black protestors in the British colony of Jamaica marched for justice, land reform, and the vote. The British governor of Jamaica, Edward Eyre, declared martial law and authorized reprisals that killed <a href="https://victorianweb.org/history/empire/westindies/eyreaffair.html">439 Black Jamaicans</a>, including the illegal hanging of former slave George Gordon, a member of the Jamaica House of Assembly (and nowadays a <a href="https://jis.gov.jm/information/heroes/george-william-gordon/">National Hero of Jamaica</a>).

A massive multiyear controversy broke out in Britain over the carnage, but the British government refused to even prosecute Governor Eyre. The Jamaica Committee was formed to privately prosecute Eyre for murder. It was soon led by John Stuart Mill, and Huxley signed up, along with other scientists and radicals. When Darwin himself joined, Huxley wrote to thank him for joining, quote, "the right (that is <u>my</u>) side." (emphasis original)

The Ad Hoc Committee Report suggests that, quote, "Huxley’s views were firmly within the mainstream of Victorian thought," unquote. The massive opposition to the Jamaica Committee gives lie to that claim. The Governor Eyre Defense Fund was supported by John Tyndall, John Ruskin, Thomas Carlyle, Alfred Tennyson, 40 generals, 26 admirals, 400 clergy, 6 bishops, 20 Ministers of Parliament, 71 peers of the House of Lords, and 30,000 others, including Charles Dickens. That’s right: if, during this Christmas season, you see Charles Dickens' story about Ebenezer Scrooge, A Christmas Carol, you should keep in mind that Dickens was on the wrong side. 

The Jamaica Committee had only 800 supporters, so the Victorian elites were 40:1 against Huxley and his colleagues. Huxley took a stand against all of these elites. This is who you are de-naming, if you de-name Huxley.

Huxley took flack for his stand. James Hunt went after him. Hunt had been fighting with Huxley since 1863 over whether or not Black people were a transitional species between apes and whites -- Huxley used words like "nonsense", "quack", "thoroughly disgusted", and "imposter" in response to Hunt. When Huxley joined the Jamaica Committee, Hunt accused him of, quote, "equal-rights mania" and, quote, "Negro-mania", and joked that Huxley would soon be saying that gorilla-hunters should be prosecuted for murder.

Hunt and his friends wanted to "cancel" Huxley and devote anthropology to studying the hierarchical "laws of race." If you de-name Huxley, you are accomplishing something that Hunt never could. 

Fortunately for the history of science and of Britain, it was Huxley that crushed Hunt. Virulent racism dominated Darwinism in countries like Germany, but its influence was weaker in the U.K., in part because of Huxley.

In conclusion, as we all know, the effort to dename Huxley College took off in the wake of the murder of George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter protests. And it is understandable, in the heat of legitimate rage against racial injustice and the rabid bigotry of the Trump era, that getting rid of Huxley, because his antiracism was imperfect, can seem like a way to "do something". 

But consider this: what was the Jamaica Committee, if not an early expression of the principle that Black Lives Matter -- that law enforcement is subject to the same laws as everyone else, that racists who murder Black people should be held accountable under the law, and that Black people deserve the same rights as everyone else? Huxley was already there in 1865, and defended that position against massive opposition.

How does it serve justice to treat T.H. Huxley as if he were James Hunt or Governor Eyre, when he actually was their vehement opponent? 

If you de-name Huxley, you are de-naming an anti-racist ally, perceived as such at the time by both sides, who defended the principle that Black Lives Matter. 

Thank you for your time.
