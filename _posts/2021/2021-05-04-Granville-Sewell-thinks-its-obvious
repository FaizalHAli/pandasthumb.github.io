Granville Sewell is at it again, and he never seems to learn.  In <a href="https://evolutionnews.org/2021/04/some-problems-can-be-proved-unsolvable/">a piece at the Discovery Institute's site Evolution News &amp; Science Today</a> 
he argues that it is obvious that one can reject the ordinary processes of physics, chemistry, and evolution as having brought about living organisms. His piece is entitled "Some problems can be proved unsolvable".
He mentions a mathematical theorem that was finally proven after hundreds of years (Fermat's Last Theorem), and a task that can easily shown to be unsolvable
(covering with two-square-sized dominos a chessboard that has had the squares in its opposite corners removed).  Then he argues that it is obvious that evolving present-day
life that ends up inventing iPhones can easily be seen to be impossible by natural processes.

He summarizes his argument in a few sentences:
[quote]
Well, I have a very simple proof that the biological problem #3 posed above is also impossible to solve, that does fit in the margin of this document. All one needs 
to do is realize that if a solution were found, we would have proved something obviously false, that a few (four, apparently) fundamental, unintelligent 
forces of physics alone could have rearranged the fundamental particles of physics into libraries full of science texts and encyclopedias, 
computers connected to monitors, keyboards, laser printers and the Internet, cars, trucks, airplanes, nuclear power plants and Apple iPhones. 
<p/>
Is this really a valid proof? It seems perfectly valid to me, as I cannot think of anything in all of science that can be stated with more confidence than that a few unintelligent forces of physics alone could not have rearranged the basic particles of physics into Apple iPhones.

Now Sewell is a mathematician, author of a book on solving differential equations.  But he seems to accept proof-by-obviousness, a method most mathematicians
would not accept.
