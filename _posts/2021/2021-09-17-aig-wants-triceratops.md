The creationists at Answers in Genesis do a twice weekly “news” show called, unsurprisingly, “Answers News.” Besides their usual nonsense, <a href="https://youtu.be/uEnGzwOguyQ ">this week</a>, approximately 15 minutes in, they state that they want one of their followers to buy a <a href="https://www.livescience.com/big-john-triceratops-auction.html">triceratops that is up for auction in France</a> and donate the fossil to the Creation Museum. They estimate that the triceratops will bring in $1.8 million at auction. The triceratops was unearthed in South Dakota, so they argue that it should be repatriated to the US. If anything ever illustrates why the commercialization of fossils, especially vertebrates, is not a good thing, this is it.
