<figcaption><a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/in/usa/boulder">Eclipse of the Moon</a>, just before totality, as seen in Boulder, Colorado, May 26, 2021. The eclipse occurred when <a href="https://www.space.com/super-flower-blood-moon-total-lunar-eclipse-2021-guide">the Moon was approximately at perigee</a> and looked about 10&nbsp;% larger than usual. (I did not, however, think the Moon looked exceptionally large owing to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_illusion">Moon illusion</a>; I have no idea why not.) The eclipse occurred just before sunrise, so the sky was becoming bright and the Moon was not visible during totality. The Moon dipped below the horizon before emerging from totality, and for us the eclipse was over.
