The ever-astonishing site Evolution News and Science Today has astonished once again.  Finding a paper in the
scientific literature which provides evidence for a horizontal gene transfer event, they declare that
this shows that [common descent is an untestable
concept](https://evolutionnews.org/2021/11/case-study-inadvertently-shows-why-universal-common-descent-is-untestable/)

The paper is in the journal Molecular Biology and Evolution: [Citrullination was introduced into animals by horizontal gene transfer from
cyanobacteria](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/advance-article/doi/10.1093/molbev/msab317/6420225)  (Disclosure: I have
published in that journal, and served as President of its pafrent society).

The paper straightforwardly provides evidence from molecular phylogenies and functional studies that the enzyme
peptidylarginine deaminase has a distribution discordant with the overall phylogeny of life, in that
> The animal and cyanobacterial PADI proteins share functionally relevant primary and tertiary synapomorphic sequences
> that are distinct from a second PADI type present in fungi and actinobacteria .... The consilience of evidence
> indicates that PADIs were introduced from cyanobacteria into animals by horizontal gene transfer (HGT).

Aha! exclaims EN&amp;ST. About Universal Common Descent, they note that
>  UCD is often held to be testable via the counterfactual of "genes and proteins might have been discovered in
>  groups where they should not exist". In other words, if we observed genes and proteins occurring in the TOL,
>  with unequivocal homology to the same sequences found elsewhere in phylogenetically distant or divergent groups, UCD
>  would be in trouble. 
And indeed they think it is in trouble:
> UCD's big entourage only becomes a problem when its members always pay the fines for UCD's failed
> predictions, pick up UCD's tab at restaurants and hotels, and generally cover the empirical shortfalls of UCD.
and they end with the declaration that
> If ever anyone needed evidence of the
> untestability of UCD, papers like this provide it.

The even-more-astonishing Denyse O'Leary ("News" at Uncommon Descent) also [made the same point](https://uncommondescent.com/darwinism/a-friend-says-this-paper-illustrates-that-universal-common-descent-is-untestable/),
attributing it to "a friend"; one of the two of them also seems to be a friend of EN&amp;ST.

I could argue with these dramatic conclusions, but the commenters here at PT might well do a better job.  So let's hear what
you have to say.
