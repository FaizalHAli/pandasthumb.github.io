Contemporary theories of evolution involve mutation as the ultimate source of
variability, and model it as having a distribution of directions which is independent
of the needs of the organism. It is natural selection that provides the
directionality of evolutionary change.  There can hardly be any assertion in
the theory that is more disliked by creationists and ID advocates.  Now they
have found a way to oppose this view: argue that randomness cannot be part
of the explanation of any phenomenon that we claim to have explained
scientifically.

Alas, there is an unfortunate side effect of this position: many scientific
theories have to be tossed out if we accept it.  Let me explain ...

The general principle was stated by Eric Holloway, in a post <a href="https://mindmatters.ai/2021/08/randomness-is-not-a-scientific-explanation/">"Randomness is
not a Scientific Explanation"</a> on the Discovery
Institute's site "Mind Matters" on 9 August 2021.  Mind Matters, a blog
of the DI's Walter Bradley Center for Natural and Artificial Intelligence,
is devoted
to making profound arguments as to why artificial intelligence will forever
remain unintelligent, because only supernatural forces can create an
intelligent system.  The article was of course immediately <a href="https://uncommondescent.com/intelligent-design/at-mind-matters-news-randomness-is-not-a-scientific-explanation/">greeted with enthusiasm</a>
at Uncommon Descent.

<a
href="https://mindmatters.ai/2021/08/randomness-is-not-a-scientific-explanation/">Here</a> is Holloway's argument:

> It is common in the sciences to claim aspects of our universe are random:
>   1. In evolution, mutations are random.
>   2. In quantum physics, the wave collapse is random.
>   3. In biology, much of the genome is random.
>   4. In business theory, organizational ecologists state new ideas are random.
>
> There is a general idea that everything new has its origins in randomness.
> This is because within our current philosophy of science, the two fundamental
> causes in our universe boil down to randomness and necessity. Since necessity
> never creates anything new, then by process of elimination the source of
> newness must be randomness. Similar to how the ancient Greeks believed the
> universe originated from chaos.
>   
> Here's  the irony of the view that whatever is unique in our universe is
> random: We can never know if anything is truly random. This is because
> randomness is unprovable, which was proven by three different computer
> scientists: Ray Solomonoff, Andrey Kolmogorov, and Gregory Chaitin.
> The only thing we can know is that something is not random. Hence, we can
> never know that something originated from randomness.
>  
> What does this result mean for science? It means that randomness can never be
> a scientific explanation, since we can never know that something is random. At
> best, saying something is random is shorthand for "we don't know".
> So, when scientists state the origin of something in our universe is random,
> they do not know the origin.

Well, that takes care of it, doesn't it?  Instead of modeling the mutational
process as random, in order to be part of a scientific theory, we must
describe the actual causes of mutation so as to be able to predict individual
mutations.  Right?

Well, not so fast.  Are there other models used in science that involve
random events?  Yes, definitely.  Here are a few I can think of:

1. Random times of decay of radioactive atoms.
2. Random movements of molecules when they diffuse in solutions.
3. Brownian motion of particles in gases or liquids.
4. The movement of molecules in a gas, and the distribution of velocities
that results.
5. Random segregation of chromosomes in meiosis.
6. Random changes of gene frequency in a population (random genetic drift).
7. Rolls of dice, spins of roulette wheels, or fall of cards in gambling.

Those are just the ones I can think of, I'm sure there are many more.  If
Holloway's argument is accepted, all of these successful scientific theories
will need to be discarded  Maybe even probability theory.  The Discovery Institute has just carried out
the greatest revolution in scientific explanation ever. Or tried to, anyway.

Note that none of these theories actually asserts that the universe is
fundamentally stochastic, or fundamentally deterministic.  It just has
phenomena in it that are well-modeled by models involving randomness, which
is a much more limited assertion.

If someone wants to argue that the argument applies to its original intended
target but not to any of the phenomena on the above list, I would be
interested to hear that.  Though I may be profoundly skeptical of that.

So, does Holloway's argument work?  Has science been revolutionized?  Any
discussion?
    
_I wish to thank the Discovery Institute for making a science blogger's life easy._
