These pictures, which I gratefully borrowed from Wikipedia, are occasioned by an <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/371/6536/1312.full">an article</a> by Erich D. Jarvis of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Briefly, Dr. Jarvis describes work by Sheela Turbek and colleagues at the University of Colorado showing that <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/371/6536/eabc0256">the two species pictured above are separated by female choice</a>. That is, they share the same geographical region, but are mostly reproductively isolated by sexual selection mediated by plumage and song. The two species differ in three genomic regions, two of which are related to plumage, and one of which is on a sex chromosome that is found in both males and females. Most likely we are seeing speciation in real time, and eventually the two species will be wholly reproductively isolated.
