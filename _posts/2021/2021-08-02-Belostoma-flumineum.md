<a href="https://bugguide.net/node/view/368937"><i>Belostoma flumineum</i></a> – Giant water bug – and <a href="https://bugguide.net/node/view/17932"><i>Notonecta kirbyi </i></a> – backswimmer prey: The photographer writes, "I'm not <i>absolutely</i> sure of the prey species, but we'll pretend that I'm confident/competent. I had collected some aquatic arthropods from a glorified ditch for some detailed aquarium shots, when the water bug cooperatively snagged the backswimmer for a meal – not exactly rare, because they're notoriously rapacious. The macro aquarium allowed both good lighting and a decent angle to fit within the short depth of field, and I cannot recommend one enough. The $5 'breeder' aquarium had one plastic side removed and replaced with a pane of glass from a photo frame for better clarity, allowing for desktop aquatic photos."
