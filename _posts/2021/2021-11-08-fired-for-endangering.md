<p>An observant reader sent us <a href="https://www.facebook.com/aigkenham/photos/4898302493533401">this picture</a>, which was the subject of a tweet by Ken Ham of AIG, and noted that the caption should have been</p>

<p><strong><big>"Fired because my beliefs endangered the health and safety of others."</strong></big></p>

<p>He further commented,</p>

<blockquote><p>Seriously, it doesn't bother AiG to fire or not to hire people because they don't believe what the organization requires (this behavior is legal under the Civil Rights Act, BTW, if carefully structured). SO why do they take such umbrage when someone else does the same thing?</p> 

<p>And, there certainly is a clear and present danger to acting on these [anti-vaccination] beliefs, whereas I would be hard pressed to find such a danger among, say, other Christian denominations that do not follow the bizarre twists that AiG insists on. </p></blockquote><p>You may read about First Liberty Institute (mentioned in the figure) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Liberty_Institute">here</a>.
