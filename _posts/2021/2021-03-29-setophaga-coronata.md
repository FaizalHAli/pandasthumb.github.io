<figcaption><a href="https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Yellow-rumped_Warbler/id">Setophaga coronata</a>, yellow-rumped warbler (aka myrtle warbler). Mr. Rintoul writes that the warbler "was photographed on a winter day in Manhattan, Kansas. This warbler, unique among the North American wood warblers, has the ability to digest the waxy coatings of various fruits such as bayberry, cedar, and myrtle. This adaptation allows them to winter further north than most warblers, which mostly depend on insects during the winter months."
