It's been several days <a href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/04/forrest_mims_cr.html">since the attacks on University of Texas ecologist Eric Pianka</a> first began, and there's no end in sight. Yesterday, <a href="http://www.seguingazette.com/story.lasso?ewcd=cd2b75fbabb8a467&page=all">Texas governor Rick Perry's office compared Pianka to the Nazis</a>, and <a href="http://www.dailytexanonline.com/media/storage/paper410/news/2006/04/05/TopStories/Ut.Professor.Receives.Death.Threats-1783524.shtml?norewrite200604061756&amp;sourcedomain=www.dailytexanonline.com">today he is being required to talk to the FBI</a> so that they can make sure that he's not a terrorist. Meanwhile, various portions of the right-wing community are continuing to rave against Pianka - the <a href="http://www.uncommondescent.com/">Uncommon Descent folks</a> alone have no less than four posts up on the topic today.

Also today, the Seguin Gazette-Enterprise (the local paper that got the ball rolling on this whole affair)  <a href="http://seguingazette.com/story.lasso?ewcd=3817403731ee3d74&page=all">posted the transcript</a> of another, more recent, speech by Pianka. This is interesting because the transcript is for the same speech discussed in <a href="http://story.seguingazette.com/drudge.html">the April 2nd Gazette-Enterprise article</a> that was picked up by the Drudge report, sparking the national outcry. Having the transcript available makes it much easier to critically examine the news article about the speech, and to see how well the material in the article reflects what was actually said.
