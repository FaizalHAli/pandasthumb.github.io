This week's <em>Nature</em> <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v443/n7113/full/443746a.html">reports</a> on the expansion of John van Wyhe's <a href="http://darwin-online.org.uk/">massive online archive</a> of Darwin writings, hosted by the University of Cambridge.  I believe it now includes all of Darwin's books and articles (yes, Virginia, Darwin <a href="http://darwin-online.org.uk/contents.html#periodicals">wrote journal articles</a>), except maybe the second edition of <a href="http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Freeman_InsectivorousPlants.html"><i>Insectivorous Plants</i></a>.  The <a href="http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Freeman_InsectivorousPlants.html">first edition</a> was published in 1875, but was revised in 1888 by Francis Darwin.  So maybe that is a grey area, but I can still whine about it.
