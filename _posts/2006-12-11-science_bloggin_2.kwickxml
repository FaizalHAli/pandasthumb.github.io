The <a href="http://mistersugar.stikipad.com/blogtogether/show/HomePage">Science Blogging Conference</a> has been growing quickly.  It is now looking for its <a href="http://mistersugar.wufoo.com/reports/science-blogging-conference-registration/">100th registrant</a>.  <a href="http://mistersugar.wufoo.com/forms/science-blogging-conference-registration/">Will you be him or her</a>?

Remember, if you come to the conference, Prof. Steve Steve will be on hand to drink you under the table like he drank down <a href="http://www.scienceblogs.com/intersection/">Chris Mooney</a>.

While you're at it, go vote of us again for the <b><a href="http://2006.weblogawards.org/2006/12/best_science_blog.php">Best Science Blog of 2006</a></b>.  You can vote once every twenty-four hours.  Right now we are in a race with <a href="http://www.corante.com/pipeline/">In the Pipeline</a> for third place.  Please don't let us lose to a the blog of a big-oil executive who wants to open-pit mine the Arctic Wildlife Refuge (or whatever <a href="http://www.corante.com/pipeline/">In the Pipeline</a> is really about).
