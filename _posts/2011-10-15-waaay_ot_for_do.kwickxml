Barnes & Noble is bringing out a <a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/Westlake?store=ebook&keyword=Westlake">slew of Westlake books</a> for the Nook late this month.  Westlake, who <a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/01/ot-donald-westl.html">died nearly three years ago</a>, was the creator of John Archibald Dortmunder, one of the great comic criminals in the genre, and it looks like a <a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/Dortmunder?store=ebook&keyword=Dortmunder">bunch of the Dortmunder books</a> are among those being published for the Nook.
