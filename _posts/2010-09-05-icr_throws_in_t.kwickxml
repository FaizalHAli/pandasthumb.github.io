The Institute for Creation Research has apparently closed its graduate school after being denied the authority to offer a master's degree in science education. See the <a href="http://www.icr.org/article/5527/">concession</a> by Henry Morris III.  The  National Center for Science Education <a href="http://ncse.com/news/2010/09/icr-not-out-woods-yet-006161">reports</a>, however, that the ICR is opening instead a School of Biblical Apologetics, which will offer a master's degree in Christian education, as well as a minor in creation research.  The graduate school may be exempt from licensing requirements as long as it offers purely religious degrees.
