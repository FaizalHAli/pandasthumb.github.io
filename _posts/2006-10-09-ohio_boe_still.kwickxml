The word out of Ohio today is that the <url href="http://www.ode.state.oh.us/GD/Templates/Pages/ODE/ODEPrimary.aspx?page=2&TopicRelationID=574">Ohio Board of Education</url> is still <url href="http://www.ohioscience.org/CI_Deferred.shtml">stalling</url> on its prior commitment to have an up-or-down vote on a "replacement policy" for the ill-fated "<url href="http://www.ohioscience.org/lesson-plans.shtml">Critical Analysis of Evolution</url>" benchmark and lesson plan which were <url href="">defeated back in February</url>.  This is in marked contrast to a recent report in the press in which a board member <url href="http://www.dispatch.com/text/stories/20061007-B5-00.php">claimed the debate template was "dead"</url>.

For the history, see these <url href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient-ff&ie=UTF-8&rls=GGGL,GGGL:2006-36,GGGL:en&q=site:www.pandasthumb.org+ohio+debate+template">previous posts</url>.  Evidently the situation is that the creationists don't have the votes for their plan to survive an actual vote, so they are stalling in the hope that circumstances will change or the Ohio science community will lose interest and stop lobbying for quality science education in their state. Good luck with that.  I am also sure that <url href="http://www.evolutionnews.org/2006/10/darwinists_in_ohio_show_true_c.html">Discovery Institute lobbying</url> and promotion of the "<url href="http://www.ohioscience.org/CI_Response.shtml">Controversial Issues Debate Framework</url>" will help the creationist cause on the Board.  It's a bit like wearing a T-shirt that says "Covert attempt at religious establishment underway!" on the front.

In other news, intelligent design has nothing to do with religious apologetics either, especially not in <url href="http://www.arn.org/blogs/index.php/3/2006/10/09/the_case_for_a_creator_dvd_available">the new ID video <i>Case For a Creator</i></url> which is allegedly <url href="http://www.arn.org/blogs/index.php/3/2006/10/09/the_case_for_a_creator_dvd_available">just peachy for public schools</url>.  I'm sure the video is much different than the <url href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0310240506/"><i>Case for a Creator</i> book</url> upon which it is based, by professional apologist Lee Strobel.  I'm sure it is also dramatically different from <url href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/index=books&field-author-exact=Lee%20Strobel&rank=-relevance%2C%2Bavailability%2C-daterank/102-0198211-9774546">Strobel's dozens of other books</url>, including <i>The Case for Faith</i>, <i>The Case for Easter</i>, <i>The Case for Christmas</i>, <i>The Case for Christ</i>, <i>The Case for Christ for Kids</i>, <i>The Case for a Creator for Kids</i>, <i>The Case for Faith for Kids</i>, <i>Off My Case for Kids: 12 Stories to Help You Defend Your Faith</i>, <i>The Case for Faith Miniature Edition</i>, and <i>Caso de Cristo, El</i>.  Strobel and his business have every right to keep doing what they are doing, of course, but they don't have any more right to governmental endorsement of their religious view than, say, <url href="http://www.friendsofsouthasia.org/textbook/index.html">the Vedic Foundation did</url>.
