This year it is being held at Colorado State University in Fort Collins, CO.  This yearly conference is the biggest in the field of evolutionary biology.  (Next to, of course, the secret meetings in the White House basement where we worship Darwin, push our conspiracy forward, and destroy all the evidence that disproves our religion.)   The Evolution Conference is jointly sponsored by <a href="http://lsvl.la.asu.edu/evolution/">the Society for the Study of Evolution</a>, <a href="http://systbiol.org/">the Society of Systematic Biologists</a>, and <a href="http://www.amnat.org/">The American Society of Naturalists</a>.

This year's <a href="http://evolution04.biology.colostate.edu/schedule.html">schedule</a> includes symposia on estimating clade ages, adaptation during ecological invasions, biological diversity, teaching evolution, sexual dimorphism, and evolution of plant phenotypes.

I will be attending, but not presenting anything.  Will any of our readers be going as well?   Next year's conference is in Alaska, and I hope to present some of my research there.
