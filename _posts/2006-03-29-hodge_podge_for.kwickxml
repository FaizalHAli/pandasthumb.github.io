For once, I'm not the one writing the microbiology/evolution convergence stuff.  Over at <a href="http://mikethemadbiologist.blogspot.com">Mike the Mad Biologist</a>, check out his post discussing <a href="http://mikethemadbiologist.blogspot.com/2006/03/viruses-phylogeny-and-venezuala-oh-my.html">Viruses, phylogeny, and Venezuela</a>, discussing how phylogenetic analysis is used to track the evolution of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus.  As Mike notes, "This study is a really good example of how biologists use evolution to understand structure and function."

On <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aetiology">Aetiology</a>, I have a discussion running about <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aetiology/2006/03/certainty.php">certainty</a>, and the "I know what I know; do not confuse me with the facts" mentality that many of you accustomed to dealing with IDers/creationists will recognize.
