I mentioned back in May that myself and a <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aetiology/2007/05/science_bloggers_storm_toronto_1.php">group of science bloggers</a> went and got ourselves interviewed by Chris Condayan of The American Society for Microbiology's <a href="http://www.microbeworld.org/">MicrobeWorld</a>.  Well, the video ("Microblogology") is up, featuring fellow U of Iowan <a href="http://www.johnlogsdon.blogspot.com">John Logsdon</a>, <a href="http://ttaxus.blogspot.com">Jonathan Badger</a>, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/lenore138">Yersinia</a>, <a href="http://schaechter.asmblog.org">Elio Schaechter</a>, and <a href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com">Larry Moran.</a>  

From the blurb:  "Six science bloggers talk about why they blog, the role of blogging in science, feedback they've received and the greatest microbiological discovery in the past decade."   I'm including the video after the jump; just be warned that I talk *really* fast and tend to be a bit animated when I'm not consciously slowing myself down.  (As I mentioned before, this is why I tend to stick to print media!).
