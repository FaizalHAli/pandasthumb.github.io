I was recently <a href="http://www.paw-talk.net/blog/19-general/1836-the-evolutionary-man-.html">interviewed</a> by the blog <a href="http://www.paw-talk.net/">Paw-Talk</a>, as were <a href="http://www.paw-talk.net/blog/19-general/1834-monkey-man.html">Evil Monkey</a> of the blog <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/neurotopia/">Neurotopia</a> and <a href="http://www.paw-talk.net/blog/19-general/1830-a-bug-girls-life.html">Bug Girl</a>, of  <a href="http://membracid.wordpress.com/">Bug Girl's Blog</a>.  Paw-Talk seems to be a blog for pet owners or self-described animal lovers, but the proprietress (known to me only as Ava) says she wants to include more science articles and interviews with scientists. Aside from the somewhat corny introductions, I was impressed by the quality of Ava's questions, which clearly showed that she had done her homework before she requested the interviews. I did not notice any comments on the blog, but the Website also features a discussion board that looked well-attended.
