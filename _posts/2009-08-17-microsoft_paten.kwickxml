According to an <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/325/5941/664">article in Science</a> this week, Microsoft has basically tried to patent phylogenetics, with their application, <a href="http://www.google.com/patents/about?id=gHezAAAAEBAJ">Clustering Phylogenetics Variation Pattern</a>.  None of the broadly written claims in the patent application are novel, and most have been used by scientists for nearly two decades.  I think <a href="http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/felsenstein.html">Joe Felsenstein</a> should walk over to Redmond and hit them with a cluestick or at least throw <a href="http://www.sinauer.com/detail.php?id=1775">his book at them</a>.

Many systematics blogs have weighed in on this application: <a href="http://www.zelnio.org/2009/08/14/patenting-systematics-revisited/">Kevin Zelino</a>, <a href="http://treethinkers.blogspot.com/2009/08/microsoft-patents-phylogenetic.html">Dechronization</a>, <a href="http://myrmecos.wordpress.com/2009/08/13/will-microsoft-own-phylogenetics/">Myrmecos</a>, and <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/topics/biotech/patents/systematics-microsoft-patent-comparative-method-pennisi-2009.html">John Hawkes</a>, to name a few.
