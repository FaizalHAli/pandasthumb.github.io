This should have happened last week, but longtime PT contributor and author of the much-beloved <url href="http://www.talkdesign.org/faqs/hunch/hunch.html">"The Quixotic Message", or "No Free Hunch"</url>, and also the equally beloved <url href="http://www.talkdesign.org/faqs/hunch/IDnotes.html">Quixotic References</url>, formerly known as theyeti, and catcher of <url href="http://stevereuland.blogspot.com/2006/04/friday-animal-blogging_14.html">broadheaded skinks</url> and <url href="http://stevereuland.blogspot.com/2006/04/friday-animal-blogging.html">legless glass lizards</url>, <url href="http://stevereuland.blogspot.com/2006/04/why-hydrogen-is-stupid.html">mild critic of hydrogen as an alternative fuel</url>, <b>HAS SUCCESSFULLY DEFENDED HIS PHD!!!</b> (although he somehow <url href="http://stevereuland.blogspot.com/2006/04/what-hell.html">lost his original post announcing this</url>).  He somehow managed to do this while writing <url href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=mozclient&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&q=site:www.pandasthumb.org+%22posted+by+steve+reuland%22">all of these great PT posts</url>, including classics like <url href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2004/07/phillip_johnson_1.html">Phillip Johnson's Bold Stand</url> and <url href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2004/10/phillip_johnson_2.html">Phillip Johnson's Bold Stand, Redux</url>.

More importantly, Steve can now finally achieve his true reason for getting a PhD, which was to join <url href="http://www.ncseweb.org/resources/articles/3697_the_list_2_16_2003.asp">the list</url> of <url href="Project Steve">Project Steve</url> Steves.

I don't actually know what Reuland's PhD was about, something biomedical I think, but for now I think I will assume it had something to do with getting <url href="http://stevereuland.blogspot.com/"> Sunbeams From Cucumbers</url>.
