**Jonathan Wells (2006) _The Politically Incorrect Guide to Darwinism and Intelligent Design_. Regnery Publishing, Inc. Washington, DC.**<sup>[Amazon](amazon://1596980133)</sup>

**Synopsis:** One thing is for sure, Jonathan Wells is too modest.  His recently published, _The Politically Incorrect Guide to Darwinism and Intelligent Design_, is not only politically incorrect but incorrect in most other ways as well: scientifically, logically, historically, legally, academically, and morally.
