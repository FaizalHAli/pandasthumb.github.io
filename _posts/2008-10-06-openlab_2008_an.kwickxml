First, there was the <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2007/01/conference_blogging.php">First NC Science Blogging Conference</a>.  Then, there was the <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2008/01/science_blogging_conference_vi.php">Second NC Science Blogging Conference</a>.  And yes, we will have the Third one - renamed <b>ScienceOnline'09</b> to better reflect the scope of the meeting: this time bigger and better than ever.

ScienceOnline'09 will be held Jan. 16-18, 2009 at the <a href="http://www.sigmaxi.org/">Sigma Xi Center</a> in Research Triangle Park, NC.

Please join us for this <b>free</b> three-day event to explore science on the Web.

The conference is organized jointly by <a href="http://blogtogether.org/">BlogTogether</a>, the North Carolina bloggers' group, and <a href="http://www.duke.edu/web/wise/">WiSE @ Duke</a>, the Women in Science and Engineering organization at Duke University, with help from Sigma Xi and other sponsors.

The people behind the organization are <a href="http://mistersugar.com/">Anton Zuiker</a>, <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/">Bora Zivkovic (aka Coturnix)</a> and <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/terrasig/">Abel Pharmboy</a>, with additional generous help by <a href="http://yesh.com/">Brian Russell</a> and <a href="http://ibiblio.org/pjones/blog">Paul Jones</a>.
