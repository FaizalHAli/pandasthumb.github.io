What has the ID movement been up to, following <i>Kitzmiller</i> and subsequent defeats?  Apparently, they are going back to their base.  In 2006 and 2007, the ID movement has hosted a number of "conferences" around the country.  They call them "conferences" because it sounds scientific, but they are more like weekend revivals, actually, where the ID guys are flown in, give their standard talks to the public, and with a full-time professional apologist like Thomas Woodward (<url href="http://www.apologetics.org/recent-events.html">apologetics.org</url>) or <url href="http://www.leestrobel.com/">Lee Strobel</url> (author of <i>The Case for a Creator</i>, <i>The Case for Christ</i>, <url href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/10/ohio_boe_still.html">etc</url>.) emceeing the event.  In fact, the "largest ID conference ever held" <url href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/08/why_debates_are.html">was held last September in the Florida Sun Dome</url>, well-known to be a common venue for scientific conferences.

So anyway, this year a series of "<b><url href="http://www.darwinvsdesign.com/">Darwin vs. Design</url></b>" conferences have been set up, apparently in a cookie-cutter format with identical guests and topics, and <url href="http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&id=262&program=CSC&isEvent=true">hosted by Lee Strobel</url>.  

The <url href="http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&id=262&program=CSC-Darwin%20vs%20Design%20Conferences&isEvent=true">bios of the speakers are online</url> (<url href="http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/filesDB-download.php?id=1281">PDF</url>).  This bit is interesting, and shows us another thing that the ID movement has been up to:

<quote>Session #3 Dr. Stephen Meyer, director of the Center for Science & Culture, editor of Darwinism, Design and Public Education, and <b>co-author of the forthcoming textbook <i>Explore Evolution</i></b>, will explain why the information encoded in DNA points powerfully to a designing intelligence.</quote>

Oh my, what a <i>clever</i> title for the new Discovery Institute textbook!  It's almost like they picked <b><url href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient-ff&ie=UTF-8&rls=GGGL,GGGL:2006-36,GGGL:en&q=explore+evolution">one of the most common phrases for mainstream evolution education projects and websites</url></b>, so that they could appear to be teaching science rather than doing religious apologetics.  

And as we all know, <b><url href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/evolution_of_creationism/">picking new labels</url></b> easily solves all conceivable problems with creationist textbooks.
