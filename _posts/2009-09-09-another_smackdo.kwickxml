As most readers know, William Dembski and Robert Marks recently published <a href="http://www.evoinfo.org/Publications/CostOfSuccess.html">a paper</a> in an <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isYear=2009&isnumber=5208652&Submit32=View+Contents">IEEE journal</a> that <a href="http://www.uncommondescent.com/intelligent-design/new-peer-reviewed-pro-id-article-in-mainstream-matheng-literature/">purports to show</a> that <blockquote>In critiquing his [Dawkins'] example and arguing that information is not created by unguided evolutionary processes, we are indeed making an argument that supports ID.</blockquote>Various science bloggers have critiqued it; see <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2009/08/quick_critique_dembski_and_mar.php">here</a>, <a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/QuintessenceOfDust/~3/OF1QQWlcmr4/weasels-clouds-and-biomorphs-part-i.html">here</a>, and <a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/08/a-peer-reviewed.html">here</a> for examples.

Now the Metropolis Sampler has published <a href="http://msampler.wordpress.com/2009/09/08/a-priori-bias-in-the-dembski-marks-representation/">a more technical analysis of the paper</a>, concluding that <blockquote>The fundamental lesson here is that the Dembski-Marks approach to evaluating model assumptions is both arbitrary and a poor reflection of scientific reasoning. Model assumptions are not accepted or rejected based on a numerical measure of how many logical possibilities that are ruled out or how far probability distributions deviate from uniform measures. Rather, model assumptions are accepted or rejected based on predictive and descriptive accuracy, domain of applicability, ability to unify existing models and empirical knowledge, and so on.</blockquote>ID creationists persistently use models that misrepresent theories (or in the case of the WEASEL hoorah, misrepresent what the model is intended to represent), and then conclude (on the basis of syntactic manipulations of the model) that the theories are invalid.  Dembski, of course, is a serial offender in this respect, and it's a pity that he's inveigled Marks into sharing his delusions.
