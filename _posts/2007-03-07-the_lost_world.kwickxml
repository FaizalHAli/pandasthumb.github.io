Make sure you don't miss <url href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA5g9Dw0zCI">this YouTube video</url> on a visit to the now-closed Dinosaur Adventure Land, home base of <url href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA5g9Dw0zCI">convicted felon Kent "Dr. Dino" Hovind</url>.  It's not exactly film festival material, but there are a lot of interesting tidbits.

An interesting phenomenon I have observed lately is that now that many Kent Hovind videos are on <url href="http://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</url>, a whole new group of people is realizing just what a wacky dude he was, and just how wacky it is that he is probably the most-known and quoted authority among the creationist public.  <url href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=kent+hovind&search=Search">Check out the Hovind-alia on YouTube</url> (if you have an afternoon to kill...the stuff is strangely addictive).
