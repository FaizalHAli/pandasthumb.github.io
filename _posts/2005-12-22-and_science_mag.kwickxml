<img alt="Cover of Science magazine, Dec. 23, 2005" src="http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/images/2005-12-22_Science_cover.gif" width="108" height="145" place="left"/><url href="http://www.sciencemag.org"><i>Science</i></url> has <url href="http://today.reuters.com/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=topNews&storyID=2005-12-22T190514Z_01_EIC268666_RTRUKOC_0_US-SCIENCE-EVOLUTION.xml&archived=False">just named its top breakthrough for 2005</url>.  You get one guess after this hint: it starts with "E."  That's right, it's <u>evolution</u>, and it is based on all of the remarkable advances in evolution in 2005, such as the comparison of the human and chimpanzee genomes, which just happens to have been <url href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/dover/day1am2.html#day1am429">featured in the <i>Kitzmiller</i> trial</url>.  I'm still hoping <i>Science</i> reprints a chunk of Jones's opinion, like they <url href="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0036-8075%2819820219%293%3A215%3A4535%3C934%3ACISTDI%3E2.0.CO%3B2-U">printed the <i>McLean</i> opinion</url> in 1982.

<b>Update:</b> The full issue is now <url href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/vol310/issue5756/index.dtl">online</url>.  Holy moly, <url href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/310/5756/1892b">Jawless Fish Have Form of Adaptive Immunity</url>.  That's big news if you're into that kind of thing.
