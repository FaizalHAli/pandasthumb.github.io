Or, you may have seen his site, <url href="http://users.rcn.com/rostmd/winace/index.htm">The Wonderful World of WinAce.</url>  This site featured the somewhat famous <url href="http://users.rcn.com/rostmd/winace/fundies/">Fundies say the darndest things!</url>, a collection of amusing quotes from around the internet, his classic <url href="http://users.rcn.com/rostmd/winace/pics/">funny pics for online use</url>, and his excellent spoof, <url href="http://users.rcn.com/rostmd/winace/designed_organisms">Organisms that look designed.</url>   What you may not have known was that this bright, funny young man was dying of cystic fibrosis (3 siblings had already died of the disease), and was recently refused by Medicaid the chance to have a lung transplant, going against his doctors' recommendations.  Allan lost his fight today; he was 20 years old and is survived by his fiancee and parents.  The world is a darker place without him in it.
