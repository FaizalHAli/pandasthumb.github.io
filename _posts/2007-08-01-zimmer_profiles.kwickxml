Today's New York Times carries a profile of evolutionary theoretician, <a href="http://www.ped.fas.harvard.edu/people/faculty/index.html">Martin Nowak</a>, written by Carl Zimmer: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/31/science/31prof.html">In Games, an Insight Into the Rules of Evolution</a>.  Zimmer elaborates on the profile <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/loom/2007/07/30/picking_up_the_dog.php">on his blog</a>.

Nowak is the director of the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics at Harvard University.  I first encountered his research in graduate school, when I was working on the evolution of language ability.  In 2002, at the <a href="http://www.ling.ed.ac.uk/evolang/2002/">Evolution of Language: Fourth International Conference</a>, I had the opportunity to have lunch with him.

He is an incredibly gifted scientist, and Zimmer's article about him is well worth <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/31/science/31prof.html">the read</a>.
