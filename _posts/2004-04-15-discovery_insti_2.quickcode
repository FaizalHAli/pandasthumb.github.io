On <a href="http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&id=1985&program=News-CSC">April 6th</a> and again on <a href="http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&id=2002&program=News-CSC
">April 13th</a> the <a href="http://www.discovery.org">Discovery Institute</a>, the leading "Intelligent Design" activists, issued press releases criticizing CNN for their coverage of anti-evolution legislation in Missouri.  On <a href="http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0404/04/sm.04.html">April 4th</a> CNN Sunday Morning reported on a Missouri Bill that would have terminated teachers who did not teach "intelligent design" creationism.

The Discovery Institute criticized CNN's coverage by stating

<quote>A bill that would have penalized teachers for not teaching intelligent design was introduced in Missouri in January, but the bill was later revised to eliminate the penalty on teachers after criticism by Discovery Institute and others.

Not only that, the revised bill is no longer under active consideration by the Missouri legislature. The bill's sponsor, Rep. Wayne Cooper, confirmed on Monday that he plans to let the bill die during the current session without a vote.
</quote>

However, the bill, <a href="http://www.house.state.mo.us/bills041/bills/HB911.htm">HB911</a>, was never revised, as anyone with an internet connection can verify at the website for the <a href="http://www.moga.state.mo.us/">Missouri General Assembly</a>.  Furthermore, CNN never reported that it was under <i>active</i> consideration, just under consideration, which it is as long as it hasn't been voted down.  This is not the first time that the Discovery Institute has been caught playing fast and loose with the facts on a story about evolution.  An amusing irony of this is how many conservative news organizations used the Discovery Institute press releases to criticize CNN for not checking their facts.  Here are the facts about the Missouri anti-evolution legislation.

<list type="1"><li>On January 7th, <a href="http://www.house.state.mo.us/bills041/member/bio155.htm">Rep. Robert Wayne Cooper (R)</a> of Camdenton, MO introduced <a href="http://www.house.state.mo.us/bills041/bills/HB911.htm">HB911</a> to the Missouri House of Representative.  This bill was brought to him by creationist organization from St. Charles, MO called "Missourians for Excellence in Science Education" which is apparently affiliated with the <a href="http://www.gennet.org">Missouri Association for Creation</a>.  This bill would standardize science along a creationist framework and would fire teachers that didn't comply.  <a href="http://www.house.state.mo.us/bills041/action/aHB911.htm">This bill was never amended</a>.

</li><li>On April 4th, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0404/04/sm.04.html">CNN Sunday Morning</a> ran a story on the Missouri bill and correctly described HB911 as proposing "a law that would fire teachers who refused to teach alternatives to evolution theory, alternatives that have not yet been widely accepted by the scientific community."

</li><li>On April 6th, the Discovery Institute issued a <a href="http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&id=1985&program=News-CSC)
">press release</a> criticizing CNN for not reporting that HB911 had been revised to no longer contain the penalty against teachers.  However, no amendments had been made to HB911 and no alternative bill had been introduced to the Missouri House of Representatives.

</li><li>On April 7th at one in the morning, <a href="http://worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=37914">WorldNetDaily</a> relying on the reports of the Discovery Institute criticizes CNN as "mischaracteriz[ing] what [the] legislation would do."

</li><li>On April 7th, Cooper introduced a new bill, <a href="http://www.house.state.mo.us/bills041/bills/HB1722.htm">HB 1722</a>, that did not contain the penalty against teachers.  This occurred a full three days after the CNN story and the day after the Discovery Institute released its complaint.

</li><li>On April 8th, <a href="http://www.family.org/cforum/fnif/news/a0031593.cfm">Focus on the Family</a> continues the conservative beating CNN.

</li><li>On April 8th, Cooper <a href="http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&id=2003&program=News
">sends a letter</a> to CNN telling them that he filed a revised bill on Febuary 23rd.  However, <a href="http://www.house.state.mo.us/bills041/jrn/jrn026.htm">the records</a> available from the Missouri General Assembly show no such submission.  In fact, <a href="http://www.house.state.mo.us/bills041/spon/spn155.htm">Cooper</a> filed no bills in February.

</li><li>On April 12th, <a href="http://headlines.agapepress.org/archive/4/122004a.asp">Agape Press</a> criticizes CNN for fabricating controversy, but ironically parrots the information it got from the anti-evolution Discovery Institute, with out trying to verify it themselves.  

</li><li>On April 13th, the Discovery Institute issued <a href="http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&id=2002&program=News-CSC">another press release</a> which still repeats the errors of its predecessor.  The claim by the Discovery Institute that the "sponsor of the Missouri bill cited by CNN submitted a revised version of his bill in February that dropped the teacher penalty provision altogether" is simply not supported by the records of the Missouri General Assembly.  Cooper did not submit his new bill until April 7th, the day after he realized that the Discovery Institute was claiming something he never did, and three days after the CNN story.

Cicero once remarked that any man can err, but only a fool persists in error.  I can't help but agree with him.  I urge John West, Associate Director of the Discovery Institute's Center for <s>the Renewal of</s> Science and Culture, that if he cares about his reputation and that of the Institute that he correct the record here.
