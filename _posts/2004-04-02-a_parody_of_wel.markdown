The infamous essays by four leading light of Intelligent Design - Johnson, Schwartz, Wells, and Dembski in the <i>World</i> online magazine wherein they offered their view of how intelligent design will vanquish science by 2025, have already received much attention in this blog. In particular, Jason Rosenhouse and PZ Myers posted rebuttals of those imbecilic predictions. The best way to relate to the nonsence of the four ID advocates seems, though, to parody them. One such parody - of Wells's contribution to World, has been written by Russell Durbin. It is available on Talk Reason site ( www.talkreason.org ) in both "What Is New" and "Serious Notions With a Smile" sections on that site. A fine piece.
