Here are the finalists of the 2018 photography contest. We received only 11 photographs from 5 photographers. All of the pictures were excellent, as you will no doubt see during the coming months. With assistance from our wife, we chose 1 photograph by each photgrapher and display them below the proverbial fold. The text, if any, was written by the photographers and lightly edited for consistency.

The finalists are presented in alphabetical order of last name. Please look through their photographs before voting for your favorite. Polling will close Friday, July 20, at approximately 12:00 MDT.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isla_Incahuasi"><i>Isla Incahuasi</i></a> (Casa del Inca) or informally called "Cactus Island." The photographer writes, "The Isla Incahuasi sits near the center of the of the Salar de Uyuni, Bolivia, the world's largest salt flat.
The predominant large cactus is Echinopsis atacamensis, which is native to Chile, Argentina and Bolivia.  The Island is many kilometers from the nearest mainland and hosts an interesting subset of the local native vegetation.  Despite its isolated location and scant rain fall, it is dramatically covered with abundant plant life."</figcaption>
