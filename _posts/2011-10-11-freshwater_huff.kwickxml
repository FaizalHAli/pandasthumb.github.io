The Huffington Post has a reputation for pitching the woo in science--witness <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/deepak-chopra/dawkins-magic-of-reality_b_1004216.html">Deepak Chopra's recent moaning</a> about Richard Dawkins' new book <i>The Magic of Reality</i> (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Magic-of-Reality-ebook/dp/B004T4KR6A">Amazon</a>; <a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/magic-of-reality-richard-dawkins/1101373498?ean=9781439192818&itm=1&usri=richard%2bdawkins">Barnes&Noble</a>).  Now, however, HuffPo reaches a new low.  In its "Education News" section a person named Doug Whiteman has a bylined article titled <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/06/john-freshwater-ohio-scie_n_997996.html?ncid=txtlnkushpmg00000007">John Freshwater, Ohio Science Teacher, Still Fired For Preaching And Keeping Bible In Class</a>.

That article is an unattributed word-for-word reproduction of the <a href="http://www.rutherford.org/articles_db/TRINEWS_release.asp?article_id=351">Rutherford Institute's press release</a> on the matter.  New lows in journalism are reachable by HuffPo, I reckon, but they'll have to work to reach them.
