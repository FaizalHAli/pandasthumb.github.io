As we all know, <i><a href="http://tiktaalik.uchicago.edu/">Tiktaalik roseae</a></i> is a magnificent example of a transitional fossil connecting aquatic critters--fish--with tetrapods, 4-limbed critters. Nevertheless, there are still gaps in that transitional sequence. A <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/02/27/1117332109">recent PNAS paper</a> (link to abstract; full paper is behind a paywall) describes fossils of early amphibians that are later than <i>Tiktaalik</i> and are within <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romer%27s_gap">Romer's Gap</a>. Romer's Gap is a period around 15 million years long, from roughly 360mya to 345mya, where (up to now) there was a distinct lack of fossils of proto-tetrapods or related critters. The new PNAS paper's senior author is <a href="http://www.theclacks.org.uk/jac/">Jenny Clack</a>, one of the most prominent paleontologists studying that era, (along with people like <a href="http://pondside.uchicago.edu/oba/faculty/shubin_n.html">Neal Shubin</a> and <a href="http://www.galilean-library.org/site/index.php/page/index.html/_/interviews/per-ahlberg-evolution-and-palaeontology-r50">Per Ahlberg</a>. Per was an active commenter on the late lamented Internet Infidels Discussion Board way back when I was an administrator of IIDB.

With these new fossils, the transition from water to land animals is becoming nearly as well documented as the <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-transitional/part1b.html">synapsid to mammal transition</a>.
