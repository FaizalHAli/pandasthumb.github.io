Dale McGowan, author of <a href="http://www.parentingbeyondbelief.com/">Parenting Beyond Belief</a>, has encountered a creationism-inclined science teacher in his son's school and is blogging the progress of his dealing with it.  So far there are two posts, <a href="http://parentingbeyondbelief.com/blog/?p=4504">Science, Interrupted</a> and <a href="http://parentingbeyondbelief.com/blog/?p=4520">Dear Mr. Taylor, Part 1</a>.  Some of the commenters on his posts and that on the Friendly Atheist (linked below in the hat tip) are full of bravado and I hope McGowan ignores them.  You don't start with a flame-thrower.

So far McGowan is handling it well, emailing the teacher first (he's using email to retain a record of the interaction), and asking polite but clear questions.  What he has not done, or at least not mentioned he has done, is contact <a href="http://ncse.com">NCSE</a> for advice, counsel, and support.  I've urged that in a comment on one of his posts and I here urge it publicly: Contact NCSE now, Dale!  There's no need to re-invent a wheel that's already on the ground and rolling.  NCSE exists <i>specifically</i> for this kind of situation.

McGowan's experience reinforces the fact that stealth creationists are wide-spread in the public schools, busily infecting students with doubt about honest science.  As <a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2008/10/day-4-science-c.html">one of the students who testified in the Freshwater hearing said</a>, what he learned from Freshwater is that  science can't be trusted.  And it's public school teachers like Freshwater and McGowan's "Mr. Taylor" who fan that mistrust.

<b>Update</b>

Dale McGowan has quite properly (and gently) chastised me for implying that he didn't know about NCSE.  See <a href="http://parentingbeyondbelief.com/blog/?p=4504#comment-4594">this comment</a> on his post.
