The physics community is all a-twitter (figuratively <i>and</i> literally) over the announcement today from CERN that two independent teams have detected a particle that has properties consistent with those hypothesized for the Higgs boson, the particle that gives matter mass. Ethan at <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/">Starts With a Bang</a> has some background <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2012/07/03/the-biggest-firework-of-them-all-the-higgs/">here</a> and has set up a trap for stories on it <a href="http://trap.it/#!traps/id/11a80242-6298-4e24-bae6-80e383cb92e8">here</a>.

What caught my eye today, though, was a <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/07/04/us-science-higgs-idUSBRE86008K20120704">Reuters story</a> on the discovery. In it we read<blockquote>[The Higgs boson] is the last undiscovered piece of the Standard Model that describes the fundamental make-up of the universe. The model is for physicists what the theory of evolution is for biologists.</blockquote>Lovely!
