Readers from waaaay back may recall an event I helped out with a few years ago, bringing together scientists, philosophers, and our <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aetiology/2007/02/skiff.php">resident IDist</a> to discuss evolution and intelligent design.  One of the speakers was University of Iowa professor <a href="http://www.psychology.uiowa.edu/faculty/blumberg/blumberg.html">Mark Blumberg</a>, a colleague in the Department of Psychology.  Dr. Blumberg also happens to be a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Body-Heat-Temperature-Life-Earth/dp/0674013697/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1228401527&sr=1-2">prolific</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Basic-Instinct-Behavior-Mark-Blumberg/dp/1560259000/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1228401527&sr=1-3">author</a>, and has just released his <a href="http://www.psychology.uiowa.edu/Faculty/Blumberg/FreaksofNaturethebook.html">third book</a> in 4 years:  "Freaks of Nature:  What Anomalies Tell us About Development and Evolution."   

As if that wasn't enough (and all of this while maintaining a very active laboratory, serving as Editor-in-Chief of <i>Behavioral Neuroscience</i>, and as President of the International Society for Developmental Psychobiology--and presumably sleeping at some point), he's also now <a href="http://blog.oup.com/2008/11/bridgeless-gaps/">getting his feet wet as a blogger</a>, discussing the legacy of Richard Goldschmidt, and the "bridgeless gaps" between species--and between evolutionary biologists.  Stop by and welcome him to the author side of the blogosphere (he's been a reader for awhile), and look for a review of "Freaks of Nature" here at some point in the future.
