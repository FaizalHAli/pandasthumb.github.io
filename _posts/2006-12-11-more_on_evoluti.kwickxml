My <a href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/11/the_politically_14.html">recent post on evolution and political conservatism</a> started an interesting conversation over the relationship between science, conservatism, and libertarianism, between myself and Larry Arnhart. <a href="http://darwinianconservatism.blogspot.com/2006/12/new-fusionism.html">Here</a> is Arnhart's first post, <a href="http://positiveliberty.com/2006/12/arnhart-responds-to-my-review.html">my reply</a>, his <a href="http://darwinianconservatism.blogspot.com/2006/12/another-response-to-sandefur.html">surreply,</a> and <a href="http://positiveliberty.com/2006/12/arnhart-responds.html">my most recent comment.</a>
