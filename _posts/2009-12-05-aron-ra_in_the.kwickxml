Back when I was a little baby creationism debater, back in the day when the world wide web was young, there were several gladiators who, every day on the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/talk.origins/topics">talk.origins</a> newsgroup, sallied forth and took on all comers.  These were names like PZ Myers, Wes Elsberry, John Wilkins...that's right, these guys, now famous, all were originally newsgroup junkies.  Eventually I got to meet them all in person.  But another gladiator there was, by the name of <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups/search?q=Aron-ra%2C+creationism+challenge&btnG=Search&sitesearch=">Aron-Ra, who wielded his challenge to great effect</a>.  I never got to meet him...but <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpeHrkbx9LU&feature=player_embedded">now there is YouTube</a>.

Everyone liked the <a href="http://www.ncselegacy.org/creationism/legal/annotated-bibliography-evolutionary-origin-vertebrate-immune">immune system cross</a> of Behe during the Kitzmiller case, but Aron-Ra has got the point so well he gets all the way down to the 3rd- and 4th-level emergency backup-backup excuse arguments Behe brings out to attempt to explain why his statements about the failure of the peer-reviewed literature were not refuted.  And all in just a few minutes.
