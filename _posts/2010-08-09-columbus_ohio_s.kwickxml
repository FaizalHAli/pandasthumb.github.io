<a href="http://mbi.osu.edu/publications/newsletter/vol5_iss3.pdf">Dan Siegal-Gaskins</a> (pdf; scroll to page 8), a Postdoctoral Fellow in the <a href="http://mbi.osu.edu/">Mathematical Biosciences Institute</a> at The Ohio State University, is starting up a Science Pub in Columbus.  Science pubs are a kind of <a href="http://sciencecafes.org/">Science Cafe</a>.  They're "live events that involve a face-to-face conversation with a scientist about current science topics. They are open to everyone, and take place in casual settings like pubs and coffeehouses."

The Columbus Science Pub will hold its inaugural event Tuesday September 7 at 7:00 pm in the basement of (what else?) a bar, <a href="http://www.columbusalive.com/live/content/features/stories/2008/11/06/ca_n_clock.html">Hampton's on King</a> right by the OSU campus in Columbus.  (It is a Science <i>Pub</i>, right?)  

The speaker will be Tara C. Smith, Assistant Professor of Epidemiology in the College of Public Health at the University of Iowa, Deputy Director of the University of Iowa Center for Emerging Infectious Diseases, founder of Iowa Citizens for Science, author of the Scienceblog <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aetiology/">Aetiology</a>, and a participant in the <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aetiology/2007/06/field_trip_to_the_creation_mus.php">Panda's Thumb field trip</a> to the Creomuseum.  Be warned: The <a href="http://www.facebook.com/ColumbusSciencePub?v=app_2344061033&vm=all">announcement on Facebook</a> says "7:00 pm to 2:30 am"!

I'm going to try hard to make it down to Columbus for (some of) the festivities and other Central Ahia folks are cordially invited to join us, so mark your calendars now.  I'll post a reminder a few days before the meeting.
