The University of Kansas Hall Center for the Humanities has <url href="http://www.hallcenter.ku.edu/~hallcenter/video/">put online the videos from this fall's "Difficult Dialogs" series</url>.  Included are talks by Ken Miller, Judge Jones, Richard Dawkins, Eugenie Scott, and Michael Behe.  We had some previous discussion of the Behe talk <url href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/12/behe_reveals_th.html">here</url>. (Apparently Behe was the ID guy who "discovered" that lawyers file a lot of paper with the court before, during, and after a trial, including Proposed Findings of Fact, which of course would be obvious if one had looked at the <url href="http://www2.ncseweb.org/kvd/"><i>Kitzmiller</i> documents archive</url> that NCSE has maintained since the trial began.)
