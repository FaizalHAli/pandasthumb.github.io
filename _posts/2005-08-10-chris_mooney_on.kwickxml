An adaptation of his chapter "<b>Creation Science 2.0</b>" is now up at <a href="http://www.prospect.org/web/page.ww?section=root&name=ViewWeb&articleId=10084"><i>American Prospect Online</i></a>.  It is entitled "<a href="http://www.prospect.org/web/page.ww?section=root&name=ViewWeb&articleId=10084">Inferior Design</a>."  In my <a href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2005/08/chris_mooney_th.html">previous post</a> I quoted Mooney's setup for his chapter, which describes what happened to "two talented young political thinkers," liberal Republicans at Harvard who made the case for reforming Republicanism in the 1966 <i>The Party That Lost Its Head</i>.

In "<a href="http://www.prospect.org/web/page.ww?section=root&name=ViewWeb&articleId=10084">Inferior Design</a>," Mooney gives the punchline:

<quote>Their critique was both prescient and poignant. But the authors -- Bruce Chapman and George Gilder -- have since bitten their tongues and morphed from liberal Republicans into staunch conservatives. Once opponents of right-wing anti-intellectualism, they are now prominent supporters of conservative attacks on the theory of evolution, not just a bedrock of modern science but also one of the greatest intellectual achievements of human history. Chapman now serves as president of the Discovery Institute; Gilder is a senior fellow there.

So not only have Chapman and Gilder become everything they once criticized; their transformation highlights how the GOP went in precisely the opposite direction from the one that these young authors once prescribed -- which is why the anti-intellectual disposition they so aptly diagnosed in 1966 still persists among modern conservatives, helping to fuel a full-ï¬‚edged crisis today over the politicization of science and expertise.<ref>Chris Mooney (2005), "<a href="http://www.prospect.org/web/page.ww?section=root&name=ViewWeb&articleId=10084">Inferior Design</a>," <i>American Prospect</i>.</ref></quote>
