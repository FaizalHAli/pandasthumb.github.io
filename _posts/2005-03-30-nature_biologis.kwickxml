Apparently, the [url=]Intelligent Design Network[/url] and their friends running the Kansas State Board of Education have had absolutely no luck recruiting real scientists to participate in the Antievolution show-trial they have planned for May.  Major kudos to <a href="http://www.kcfs.org">Kansas Citizens for Science</a>, their efforts are now getting noticed internationally as well as nationally.
