<img align="left" src="/archives/images/Georgia_seal.png"/>A <a href="http://www.ncseweb.org/selman/Selman_appeal_GA_constitution.pdf">seventh amicus brief (pdf)</a> in the <i>Selman case</i> has been put up on the NCSE <a href="http://www.ncseweb.org/selman/"><i>Selman</i> website</a> (<i><a href="http://www.ncseweb.org/selman/">www.ncseweb.org/selman</a></i> -- See the <a href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/pt-archives/001134.html">previous PT post</a>).  This brief is by national and Georgia religious groups (<a href="http://www.ncjw.org/">National Council of Jewish Women</a>, <a href="http://www.interfaithalliance.org/">Interfaith Alliance</a>, and <a href="http://www.interfaithalliance.org/site/apps/nl/content2.asp?c=8dJIIWMCE&b=176635&ct=146879">Georgia Interfaith Alliance</a>), and addresses the question of whether the <a href="http://www.ncseweb.org/selman/disclaimer.html">Cobb County Evolution Warning Label</a> violates the <a href="http://www.cviog.uga.edu/Projects/gainfo/conart1.htm">Bill of Rights of the Georgia Constitution</a>:

<quote>Paragraph VII. <b>Separation of church and state.</b> No money shall ever be taken from the public treasury, directly or indirectly, in aid of any church, sect, cult, or religious denomination or of any sectarian institution.<ref><a href="http://www.cviog.uga.edu/Projects/gainfo/conart1.htm">Bill of Rights of the Georgia Constitution</a></ref></quote>

It is often the case that state constitutions are even stronger on civil rights than the Federal Constitution, so constitutional challenges to policies will often invoke the local state constitution as well as the federal constitution.

The <a href="http://www.ncseweb.org/selman/Selman_appeal_GA_constitution.pdf">plaintiffs' brief in the appeal (pdf)</a> is also now available.
