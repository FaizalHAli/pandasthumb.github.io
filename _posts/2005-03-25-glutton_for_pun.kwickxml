<img align="left" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sciext/gut/images/gut_title.gif"/>The logo to the left is not some kind of April Fool's science joke that would make nerds guffaw with obscure glee.  It is the logo for the <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/sciext/gut/">special collection</a> of <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/vol307/issue5717/">this week's issue</a> of the journal <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org"><i>Science</i></a> on...the gut!  I long ago came to terms with the fact that I am a hopeless science nerd.  As such, I have a pretty good tolerance for the cute science puns commonly found in the titles of articles on science.  The <i>Annals of Improbable Research</i> recently published "<a href="http://www.improb.com/airchives/paperair/volume10/v10i4/v10i4.html">A Template for Scientific Press Releases and Science News Articles</a>" that gave university press office people guidelines and suggestions about where to place thir puns for maximum impact.  The <i>AIR</i> article even suggests example creative wordplay: "Charmed, I'm sure" for an article on quarks, or "Superconductivity has shown that resistance is futile."  But a few articles in the bowels of this week's <i>Science</i> take the punning to a whole new level.  For example, the introductory article, "<a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/307/5717/1895">The Gut: Inside Out</a>" (sort of like <i>The Matrix: Reloaded</i>, I guess), concludes with the following wildly clever series of digestion jokes:

<quote>"There are enormous amounts of information about the gut still to digest, but it is hoped that this journey through our inner tube will leave readers with an appetite to learn more."</quote>

Ha!  Rimshot, please!  But they're just getting started.  Check out these titles: "<a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/307/5717/1909">The Gut and Energy Balance: Visceral Allies in the Obesity Wars</a>," by esteemed Drs. Badman and Flier.  <i>Science</i> staffer Elizabeth Pennisi chimes in with, "<a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sci;307/5717/1897">What's Eating You?</a>"  Or see the "Focus Issue" article, "<a href="http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/stke.2772005eg4">Going for the Gut</a>."  Even evolutionary biology gets into it: "<a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/307/5717/1902">No Organ Left Behind: Tales of Gut Development and Evolution</a>."

Yes, yes, I know there is serious science in all this, with important medical implications.  But does <i>every</i> conceivable topic that is given a high-profile treatment in <i>Science</i> or <i>Nature</i> have to force feed us a platter of indigestible puns?
