The <i>Boston Globe</i> has just published a <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2005/07/27/the_evolution_of_george_gilder?mode=PF">puff-piece</a> on George Gilder.  The article is called, "<a href="http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2005/07/27/the_evolution_of_george_gilder?mode=PF">The evolution of George Gilder</a>." Anyway, the piece mostly just lets Gilder spout unchallenged about how evolution can't explain genetic "information", although it does start off OK by mentioning Pharyngula's <a href="http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/the_sanctimonious_bombast_of_george_gilder/">2004 fisking</a> of a Gilder essay in <i>Wired</i>.  For some reason, though, the reporter couldn't bring himself to make one tiny little phone call to a biologist (I'm sure <a href="http://pharyngula.org/">PZ Myers</a> was ready and willing) to learn how evolution <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&cmd=Display&dopt=pubmed_pubmed&from_uid=14634634">actually can produce new genes with new functions</a> (<a href="http://www3.uta.edu/faculty/betran/naturereviews.pdf">handy free pdf</a>).  Gilder is saying something that is the equivalent of saying "scientists don't know <a href="http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/volc/cover2.html">how volcanos form</a>."  Saying that the origin of new genetic information requires divine intervention <a href="http://www.evowiki.org/index.php/Evolution_of_new_information">is just wrong</a>, anyone who believes it is badly uninformed, <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/information/dembski.html">and</a> <a href="http://www.touchstonemag.com/docs/issues/15.5docs/15-5pg40.html">anyone</a> <a href="http://www.antievolution.org/cgi-bin/ikonboard/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST;f=9;t=6">who</a> <a href="http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&id=2177">promotes</a> <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/information/gitt.html">the</a> <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/information/spetner.html">idea</a> to the innocent public is a deluded pseudoscientist.

To end on a positive note, Gilder does manage to get <a href="http://www.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2005/07/27/the_evolution_of_george_gilder?mode=PF">one thing right</a>:
