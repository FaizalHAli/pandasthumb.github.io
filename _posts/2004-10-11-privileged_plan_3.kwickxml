Guillermo Gonzalez has posted an article at the <a href="http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&id=2229&program=CSC%20-%20Scientific%20Research%20and%20Scholarship%20-%20Science">Discovery Institute's</a> Center for <s>the Renewal of</s> Science and Culture in which he presents paleomagnetism as a supporting data point for the Privileged Planet thesis.

Privileged Planet's thesis has received some strong criticisms (Kuehn 2003, Kuehn 2004) and more recently from <a href="http://www.lectures.iastate.edu/schedule.php?print=1&showpast=">Debates at ISU</a>

Intelligent Design: Is it Science or Religion?
JOHN PATTERSON and HECTOR AVALOS

The main proponent of intelligent design and the author of Intelligent Design is William Dembski. He and his followers believe that there is scientific evidence that our universe was designed.  More recently, a publication claims that the very position of our third planet seems to be intelligently purposed. Dr. Patterson will examine these claims from the scientific side, and Dr. Avalos will examine the claim from the viewpoint of religious studies and philosophy.   John Patterson is a nationally recognized critic of pseudoscience and creationism.  Before retiring in 1995, he was a professor in the Department of Materials Science in the College of Engineering at Iowa State University. He received his doctorate. in Metallurgical Engineering from Ohio State University. He has written many scientific critiques of creationism, including "Thermodynamics and Evolution," in Scientists Confront Creationism, edited by Laurie Godfrey.   Hector Avalos is an Associate Professor of Religious Studies and the founder and Director of the U.S. Latino Studies Program at Iowa State University, where he was named Professor of the Year in 1996 and an LAS Master Teacher in 2003-04. He received a Master of Theological Studies from the Harvard Divinity School, and became the first Mexican American to earn a doctorate in biblical studies at Harvard. He is the author of four books and numerous articles. His next book is on Religion and Violence. Sponsored by Atheist and Agnostic Society

In the same week Del Ratzsch (bless his heart) will present the following during the "God at Work at ISU"

What he and Richards argue in the book and Ratzsch will say Tuesday is that categorically eliminating those explanations is a mistake.

I will show why his arguments fail. As I have shown in earlier installments in which I addressed the various flaws in the Privileged Planet thesis, the argument based on paleomagnetism is one in which habitability and measurability are strongly correlated.

The presence of a magnetic field is a requirement for life on earth so in other words, a magnetic field and habitability correlate. But similarly, a magnetic field may leave evidence of the past and thus affecting measurability. In other words, the correlation between measurability and habitability is coincidental. 

<quote>
What are the implications of all this for our argument? The presence of a long-lasting magnetic field has made Earth more habitable. The magnetic field has provided long-duration accessible magnetic records, but it also limits the effectiveness of remote sensing of the less accessible records.

And yet in Privileged Planet they only eliminate chance and fail to present any ID relevant hypothesis beyond a correlation of one data point.

The results mean it may be possible to use magnetic fields to learn more about the internal structure and composition of planets (Nature 428 151).

Knowledge of the earth's magnetic field seems to have affected measurability in a negative manner. The magnetic fields on Uranus and Neptune were at odds with our understanding of magnetic fields. 

<quote>
"The more remarkable is that the Earth's magnetic field is dipolar from where we stand on the surface and approximately axially symmetric. That's why we expect that on other planets," said Lilley.

<quote>
he axis of the earth's magnetic field is tilted about 11ï¿½ away from our planet's axis of rotation. This tilt is embarrassing to the reigning "dynamo theory," in which the axes of the magnetic field and rotation are presumed to be aligned. The situation is even worse with some the other planets; viz., Uranus with 60ï¿½ and Neptune with 47ï¿½. Jupiter's tilt is 10ï¿½, while Saturn's is only 1ï¿½. Clearly, something is awry.

Kyler Kuehn argues

<quote>
Habitability alone may be compelling (in, e.g., cosmological fine-tuning arguments), but the Privileged Planet Hypothesis requires a non-trivial correlation of both!
<ref><a href="http://www.ps.uci.edu/~kuehn/personal/ID2004.ppt">A critique of the Privileged Planet Hypothesis</a> by Kyler Kuehn presented at the <i>Intelligent Design and the Future of Science</i> conference . Biola University. April 22-24, 2004</ref></quote>



Convinced of Purpose in our universe, these arguments may appear to be convincing but such should not be confused with a scientific foundation for said 'Purpose' or even an ability of science to address the nature of this 'Purpose'. Since the Privileged Planet thesis does not identify how to measure a weighted optimality, fails to address the causal links between correlations and fails to provide more than a single datapoint (remember that their argument is a weighted one so the earth cannot be more than a single data point), I conclude that we have to reject, once again, the Privileged Planet leap of faith.


<quote>
All of this is consistent with the argument we develop in The Privileged Planet. We do not argue that habitable environments like Earth are superior to less habitable environments for every type of scientific measurement and discovery. Such an argument would be obviously incorrect. (Recall the superiority of intergalactic space for measuring the background radiation.) Rather, we argue that habitable environments provide the best overall setting for a wide range of diverse and often competing set of prerequisites for such discovery

No wonder Kyler Kuehn concludes 

<quote>
Inclusion of the Privileged Planet Hypothesis in educational curricula is not (yet) warranted.
