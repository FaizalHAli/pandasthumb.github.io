<a href="http://scienceblogs.com/tfk/2010/09/disco_rubs_out_new_writers_min.php">Josh Rosenau notes</a> that the Disco 'Tute's house organ, <i>Evolution News and Views</i>, has a new contributor, <a href="http://www.probe.org/site/c.fdKEIMNsEoG/b.4324659/">Heather <s>Sieger</s> Zieger</a>, currently a research associate at <a href="http://www.probe.org/site/c.fdKEIMNsEoG/b.4213839/k.AF17/Probe_Ministries.htm">Probe Ministries</a>, a fundamentalist ministry, one of whose co-founders is Jon Buell, publisher of "Of Pandas and People" of "cdesign proponentsists" fame.  And there's a nice wrinkle: The Disco 'Tute's description of her completely neglects her four years of apologetics work at Probe Ministries.  But it's all about the science, right?
