At the Opposing Views website, David Menton of <a href="www.answersingenesis.org">Answers in Genesis</a> has a new article up which asks: <a href="http://www.opposingviews.com/articles/opinion-did-humans-really-evolve">Did Humans Really Evolve?</a>.  Menton argues the <i>Homo erectus</i> and Neanderthal fossils are modern humans, the australopithecines are apes, and of course can't resist the opportunity to mention <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/a_piltdown.html">Piltdown</a> Man and <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/a_nebraska.html">Nebraska Man</a> (what creationist can?).

I could take issue with all of that (and have, at <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs">Fossil Hominids</a>), but there's a glaring omission in Menton's article I'd rather focus on: where on earth is <i>Homo habilis</i>??  

Menton would probably argue, as Answers in Genesis does nowadays, that <i>H. habilis</i> is an <a href="http://www.answersingenesis.org/Docs/263.asp">"invalid taxon"</a>, but there are a couple of major problems with that argument.

Firstly, <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/invalidtaxon.html">it's not true</a>. The species <i>Homo habilis</i> was defined with the fossil <a href="">OH 7</a> as a type specimen. <i>H. habilis</i> will be a valid species until that fossil is reassigned to a previously named species. That hasn't happened yet, and no creationist has even attempted to explain what species OH 7 should be assigned to if it isn't <i>habilis</i>. There <em>is</em> a lot of dispute over which fossils belong to <i>habilis</i>, but that is a dispute about whether the other 'habiline' (i.e. habilis-like) fossils belong to the same species as OH 7 or some other species - it isn't a dispute over whether <i>habilis</i> itself is a valid species.

Secondly, even if it was true, it doesn't make the fossils go away. They still need to be classified, and I would like to see Menton explain how the fossils ER 1813, ER 1470, OH 7, OH 8, OH 13, OH 16 and OH 24 should be classified if they're not <i>habilis</i>. While he's at it, he should also classify the <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/d2700.html">Dmanisi fossils</a>, which have some similarities to <i>habilis</i> and have been giving creationists <a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2008/11/dmanisi-postcranial.html">some</a> <a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2008/12/dmanisi-and-aig.html">trouble</a> lately.
