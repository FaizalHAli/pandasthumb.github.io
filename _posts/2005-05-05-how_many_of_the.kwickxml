Readers of the <i>Panda's Thumb</i> blog are, of course, all-to-familiar with ID/creationism.  But you may be less familiar with another bizarre form of pseudoscience: <b>HIV-AIDS deniers</b>.  This is a group of cranks who think that the entire biomedical establishment is wrong, and that HIV -- is not actually the cause of AIDS.  Instead, they say, some other vaguely specified cause, like drug use or sexual practices, <i>directly</i> causes AIDS, somehow.  AIDS in Africa is explained by vague reference to "tropical diseases", in contradiction to the actual tropical disease experts.  The subtexts here are that AIDS in western countries is punishment for immorality, and that people in Africa die all the time anyway.  

If you don't believe these people exist, see <a href="http://www.suppressedscience.net/aids.html">suppressedscience.net/aids.html</a> and <a href="http://www.virusmyth.net/aids/">VirusMyth.Net</a> -- the latter is the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=mozclient&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&q=AIDS+virus">top google hit</a> on "AIDS virus."  HIV-AIDS denial persists in the face of the considered opinion of <a href="http://aids.about.com/od/expertadvice/a/declaration.htm">thousands of experts</a>, despite <a href="http://www.nature.com/nm/journal/v11/n5/abs/nm0505-469.html">weekly scientific advances</a>, and despite a <a href="http://www.niaid.nih.gov/factsheets/evidhiv.htm">massive accumulation of evidence</a> in favor of HIV causing AIDS.

HIV-AIDS denial is especially pernicious because the single most important weapon in the fight against AIDS is education.  The damage can be immense when pseudoscientific cranks get the ear of politicians, as occurred with <a href="http://dir.salon.com/health/feature/2000/07/28/aidsdeniers/index.html">HIV-AIDS deniers and Thabo Mbeki</a>, the president of South Africa, one of the countries worst-hit by HIV-AIDS.

What, you may be asking, is the connection between HIV-AIDS deniers and the Kansas evolution hearings?  Well, pseudosciences have a strange way of associating with each other.  As it turns out, many prominent ID advocates are also HIV-AIDS deniers.
