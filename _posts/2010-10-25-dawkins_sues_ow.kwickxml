I have not seen this in the New York Times yet, so I guess it is not Real News, but evidently <a href="http://www.courthousenews.com/2010/10/22/31283.htm">Richard Dawkins (or the Richard Dawkins Foundation) is suing his webmaster for alleged embezzlement</a>. Dawkins alleges that the webmaster, Josh Timonen, embezzled nearly $400,000, which appears to be most of the money earned by an on-line store that Timonen operated on behalf of the foundation. Timonen has posted a reply <a href="http://joshtimonen.com/post/1387207318/the-ultimate-betrayal">here</a>. I also noticed a <a href="http://forums.randi.org/showthread.php?t=189474">discussion</a> at the James Randi Educational Foundation and a short <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/10/rdf_v_timonen.php">article</a> on Pharyngula.  The question of who owns certain intellectual property promises to have very interesting consequences.  All I know. Thanks to Abigail Smith for the tip.
