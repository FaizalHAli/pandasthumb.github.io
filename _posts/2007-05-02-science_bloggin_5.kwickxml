As the 2007 <a href="http://mistersugar.stikipad.com/blogtogether/show/2007+Science+Blogging+Conference">Science</a> <a href="http://wiki.blogtogether.org/blogtogether/show/Conference+Links+and+Liveblogging">Blogging</a> <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2007/01/conference_blogging.php">Conference</a> was such a great success, we are already in full swing in organizing the <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2007/03/announcement_get_ready_for_the.php">2008</a> <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2007/03/announcing_the_2008_science_bl.php">conference</a> and hoping to make it even bigger and better than the first one.

Our beta-version wiki is up---check out the <a href="http://mistersugar.stikipad.com/blogtogether/show/North+Carolina+Science+Blogging+Conference">homepage</a> and the first, rough outlines of the <a href="http://mistersugar.stikipad.com/blogtogether/show/Conference+Program+08">program</a> (feel free to edit the page and add your idea at the bottom or in the comments).  At this point we are trying to get more <a href="http://mistersugar.stikipad.com/blogtogether/show/Sponsorships">sponsors</a> so if you and your organization/company/magazine is interested, let us know soon.

Check out out <a href="http://blogtogether.org/">blog</a> for updates.

Last time, almost in time for the conference, we edited and published the first-ever <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2007/01/the_science_blogging_anthology.php">science blogging anthology</a>, the <a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/631016">Open Laboratory 2006</a>, which was an instant hit.  Thus, we are already collecting nominations for the <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2007/03/have_you_nominated_a_post_for.php">next years' edition</a>.  Send us your best posts (or best posts written by others) of the year by using <a href="http://openlab.wufoo.com/forms/submission-form/">this submission form</a> and help us spread the news by adding <a href="http://dererumnatura.us/archives/2007/03/openlab_2007.html">this code</a> to your blog or website.
