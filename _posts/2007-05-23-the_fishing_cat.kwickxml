A recent conversation brought up the subject of one of my favorite animals---and one of the more remarkable examples of evolution: the Fishing Cat (<em>Prionailurus viverrinus</em>). The Fishing Cat is just that---a cat that subsists on fish, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USvcrx8_OB4">that swims naturally.</a> In fact, the Fishing Cat <em>actually has webbed paws.</em>

They're a little bigger than a bobcat, about three and a half feet long (including tail), and are native to southeast Asia, where they live beside rivers, <a href="http://www.idiocentrism.com/FishingCat%20XX.jpg">hunting for fish.</a> They don't just scoop the fish out with their paws; they swim and dive under the water to catch fish. There are several zoos that have Fishing Cats, including the National Zoo in Washington; you can watch <a href="http://nationalzoo.si.edu/Animals/AsiaTrail/FishingCats/fishing/">a video of Fishing Cats hunting</a> at their website. Personally, I'm fond of the cats at the Exotic Feline Breeding Compound in Rosamond, California; they have some adorable pictures of Fishing Kittens <a href="http://www.cathouse-fcc.org/fishingcat.html">on their website.</a>
