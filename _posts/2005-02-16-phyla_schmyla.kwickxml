A great deal of ink has been spilled over the concepts of "phylum" and "bauplan."  Not a few scientists have constructed grand edifices based on the idea that "the phyla" arose "suddenly" in the Cambrian "explosion."   In <i>Wonderful Life</i>, Stephen Jay Gould used this idea to promote his view that evolutionary history is contingent and unrepeatable.  Many others have used the idea to promote various additions to evolutionary theory -- Kaufman's self-organization, claims that developmental biology will supply some radical new principle left out of the neo-Darwinian synthesis, etc.

Creationists have been only too happy to take this literature, oversimplify it, and put their own spin on it, essentially arguing that the phyla were specially created, instantaneously.  Jonathan Witt has been trying his hand at this in his latest blog entries, responding to John Derbyshire.  For instance:

The problem gets even uglier when Darwinists try to explain away the fossil record leading up to the Cambrian Explosion. What story do these strata tell? Animals didn't exist; and then they did--not just dozens of species but dozen of phyla. If you want some idea of how large a category phyla is, consider that sharks, mice, humans and otters are all members of the same phylum.

If natural selection working on random genetic mutation built this menagerie of animals, it had to do it one extraordinarily tiny, functional improvement at a time, one generation at a time, over tens and even hundreds of millions of years. If we had even a tiny fraction of a fraction of the Precambrian life forms, we would have so many transitional forms we would be hard-pressed to draw the line between one phylum and another, so thoroughly would they bleed one form into the other. But we find no such fossil pattern in the Precambrian.</quote> 

What creationists don't realize is that the whole body of thought that creationists rely on -- the idea phyla are "real" and correlate with bodyplans, that more phyla existed back in Cambrian, that there are no intermediate morphologies between the phyla -- has been under assault for some years now.

Why is it not recognized more widely that many of the kinds of changes ultimately leading to disparate forms were not unique to the Precambrian/Cambrian? One reason may be that the human mind is so impressed with large differences that it cannot easily conceive origins of such differences in small steps (see Darwin 1859:29). Perhaps focusing on typological Bauplï¿½ne exacerbates this difficulty? But a more important reason is the common misconception (also sustained by typological terms like "phylum-level body plan," "phylotypic stage," and "phylotypic process") that the taxonomic level of Phylum is primarily determined by Bauplan (or developmental stage or spatial pattern of developmental regulatory mechanisms). First, it is tautological to use Bauplan to define a particular taxonomic level if a Bauplan is itself defined as the set of features characteristic of a particular taxon. Second, it has been considered "paradoxical" that "all phyla are old" despite "repeated opportunities for the appearance of new phyla" (Raff 1996:174). This paradox is resolved by noting that the different hierarchical levels of the taxonomic system (Phylum, Class, Order, etc.) are applied arbitrarily. These taxonomic levels reflect relative divergence points in time, as Darwin (1859):420) famously recognized, not particular differences in Bauplan. That is, the groups-within-groups hierarchy of taxonomy simply derives from common ancestry at more and more ancient times (Fig. 1B). Phylum divisions represent divergences that occurred earlier than Class or Order divisions within the Phylum, regardless of the grade of difference in Bauplan (Darwin 1859). Even if an identical key innovation as that characterizing a "phylum-level body plan" arose recently from within an Order, a new Phylum could not be erected for it without upsetting the entire taxonomic hierarchy, no matter how distinct the new Bauplan (Fig. 1B). Thus, "all phyla are old" simply because of the hierarchical restrictions of taxonomy, not because fundamental key changes to body plans have not arisen more recently. A paucity of Phyla more recently emerged than the Cambrian is therefore not evidence for lack of recent innovative changes in Bauplan.</quote>
