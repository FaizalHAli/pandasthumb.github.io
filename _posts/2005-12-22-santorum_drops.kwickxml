Back in January I seem to remember the Thomas More Law Center declaring "<url href="http://www.thomasmore.org/news.html?NewsID=281">A Revolution in Evolution Is Underway</url>."  But today, according to the Associated Press, "<url href="http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/nation/20051222-0801-evolutiondebate-santorum.html">Santorum says will break ties to law firm that represented school district on intelligent design</url>."  Now, Santorum was on the TMLC board, and encouraged the Dover Area School Board early on -- see for example his January 23, 2005, op-ed in the <i>Allentown [PA] Morning Call</i>, entitled "<url href="http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&program=CSC%20-%20Views%20and%20News&id=2396">A Balanced Approach to Teaching Evolution</url>," (helpfully now hosted on the <url href="http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&program=CSC%20-%20Views%20and%20News&id=2396">Discovery Institute website</url>) wherein Santorum wrote, <b>"The Dover Area School District has taken a step in the right direction by attempting to teach the controversy of evolution."</b>

But, I guess that's what poor Thomas More gets for repeatedly citing Santorum and his <url href="http://www.ncseweb.org/resources/articles/7202_ncse_compilation_on_santorum_a_6_13_2002.asp">attempted amendment to the No Child Left Behind Act</url> -- Santorum's name came up 36 times in the <url href="http://www2.ncseweb.org/wp/?page_id=11">trial transcripts</url>, in fact.

While we're discussing law firms, it is worth checking out the press releases and related information of the <url href="http://www.aclu.org/religion/intelligentdesign/23158prs20051220.html">ACLU</url> (and <url href="http://www.aclu.org/religion/intelligentdesign/23127res20051219.html">letters they've received</url>), <url href="http://www.au.org/site/News2?abbr=pr&page=NewsArticle&id=7725&security=1002&news_iv_ctrl=1241">Americans United</url>, and the 600-pound gorilla in this case, <url href="http://www.pepperlaw.com/news.cfm?ID=922.0">Pepper-Hamilton</url>.  Sign up for the first two, and send all three your compliments -- they each made a heavy investment in this case, and even if the judge awards some fees after the win, it is highly unlikely they will recoup all of their costs.
