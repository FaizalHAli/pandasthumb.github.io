<img align="left" src="http://www.time.com/time/images/covers/1101050815_120.jpg"/>It looks like the cover of <a href="http://www.time.com/time/"><i>Time</i> magazine</a> this week is "<a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1090836,00.html">The Evolution Wars</a>."  Hopefully the story will be well-informed; several reporters called NCSE for interviews and data.  It has become office lore at NCSE that, while summers are quieter because schools and state legislatures are usually in recess, August can be a big exception.  Regular news slows down, so reporters go fishing for "odd" stories, and evolution/creationism certainly fits the bill.  Adding to the chaos this time, the director, Eugenie Scott, was <a href="http://www.ncseweb.org/GC2005/GCfaq/GrandCanyonFAQ.html">off the grid in the bottom of the Grand Canyon</a> all last week, on the <a href="http://www.ncseweb.org/GC2005/GCfaq/GrandCanyonFAQ.html">semiannual NCSE Grand Canyon Float Trip</a>.  This would be the reason why she is not quoted in the copious media coverage of Bush's comments, and why I got my 1.5 minutes of fame on the <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,144876,00.html">Fox News Tony Snow show</a> yesterday.
