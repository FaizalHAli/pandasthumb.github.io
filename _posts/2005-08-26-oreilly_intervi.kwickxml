<p>On Wednesday night, FOX News anchor Bill O'Reilly interviewed Rick Sternberg.  The subject was Sternberg's allegations of harassment at the hands of various employees of the Smithsonian Institution.  The cause of this harassment, says Sternberg, was his decision to publish a pro-ID article during his stint as editor of <i>The Proceedings of the Biological Society of Washington</i>.  For some background on the situation see the recent PT entries by Nick Matzke <a href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2005/08/sternberg_compl.html">here</a>, and by Andrea Bottaro <a href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2005/08/sternberg_and_t.html">here</a>.</p>
