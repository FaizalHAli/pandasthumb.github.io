<big>In 1999 I posted to the Talk Reason website a critical review of Professor Nathan Aviezer's book <i>In the Beginning </i> [1] and of his article <i>The Anthropic Principle</i> published in the Jewish Action journal [2]. My review was titled <i>The End of the Beginning</i> (see <a href="http://www.talkreason.org/articles/aviezer.cfm">here</a>.) [3]. Soon afterward one of my friends (on his own initiative) sent a copy of that essay to Aviezer and asked him to respond.  Professor Aviezer chose to ignore my friend's request.  Of course, Professor Aviezer was under no obligation to respond to critique. In the following years my essay evoked some discussion on the internet, but Professor Aviezer remained silent in regard to my critique. In 2003 my book <i>Unintelligent Design </i>[4] was published, wherein one chapter was a slightly modified and updated version of my essay in question. Professor Aviezer remained unresponsive to my critique.  Suddenly, in February 2012, 13 years after my review of his work appeared, Professor Aviezer posted a reply (see torahmusings.com/2012/02/fossils-and-faith ) [5].
