Over at <a href="http://immunoblogging.blogspot.com">Immunoblogging,</a> Joseph has a multi-post series on the evolution of the immune system that I've been meaning to highlight, since obviously the claim that there's no research done in this area plays a large part in IDists' claims.  So, some background reading on a few of the issues:  

<a href="http://immunoblogging.blogspot.com/2006/02/evolution-of-immune-system-mhc-part-i.html">Part One</a>
<a href="http://immunoblogging.blogspot.com/2006/02/evolution-of-immune-system-mhc-part-ii.html">Part Two</a>
<a href="http://immunoblogging.blogspot.com/2006/02/evolution-of-immune-system-mhc-part.html">Part Three</a>
and a bonus (if a bit older) post on Toll-like receptors <a href="http://immunoblogging.blogspot.com/2005/06/toll-like-receptors-and-you.html">here</a>, along with a newer overview <a href="http://immunoblogging.blogspot.com/2006/03/creationists-love-immune-system.html">here.</a>

Additionally, at the new <a href="http://goodmath.blogspot.com/">Good Math, Bad Math</a>, MarkCC discusses <a href="http://goodmath.blogspot.com/2006/03/king-of-bad-math-dembskis-bad.html">Dembski's (mis)use of the NFL theorem</a> and <a href="http://goodmath.blogspot.com/2006/03/studying-bad-probability-creation_14.html">creationist use of probability.</a>   Check 'em out.
