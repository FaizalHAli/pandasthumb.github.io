It's happening right now apparently.   So finally we might find out whether or not that crazy equatorial ring really is a spaceship runway like the UFOologists say. I mean, obviously a perfectly straight line of mountains on the equator can't be explained by natural regularities or random chance, so it's got to be ID, right?  And of course the <url href="http://creationsafaris.com/crev200709.htm#20070907a">creos will say</url> that whatever they find is evidence for a young universe.
