Although, I haven't finished the book yet, I think today, the 150th anniversary of the publication of the <i>Origin</i>, is an appropriate day to talk about it.

The book is a wonderful adaptation of the Darwin's influential original.  It beings with a history lesson about his voyage on the HMS Beagle and his return to England.  It then follows with abridged text from the <i>Origin</i> and associated graphical adaptations.  I could spend a thousand words describing the format to you, but it is more effective to simply share <a href="http://scit.us/~reed/CDOS.pp51_60.pdf">a lo-res sample</a> with you.  Although the format is great and beautiful, some of the artwork, especially people, does not look right.  I would have preferred a style of artwork more suitable to the graphical novel medium, like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Manga-Guide-Molecular-Biology-Science/dp/1593272022"><i>The Manga Guide to Molecular Biology</i></a>.---But doing it in manga form opens up the possibility of Darwin x Wallace d≈çjinshi, which makes me cower.---But this is probably just due to my taste.

Minor art issues aside, I believe that this book will make a great gift for anyone interested in science and especially biology.  I also think that it can serve as a powerful teaching tool in high school and college, due to its uniqueness.  For anyone that still has a bad taste in their mouth from Comfort's bastardization of Darwin's work, <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Charles-Darwins-Origin-Species-Adaptation/dp/160529697X">Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species: A Graphic Adaptation</a></i> will make you feel better.
