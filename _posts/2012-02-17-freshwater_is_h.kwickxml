Those who are unfamiliar with issues sometimes raised by religious fundamentalists may be excused for finding the question that is the title of this post a little weird.  But out here in Knox County, Ohio, home of <a href="http://pandasthumb.org/mt/search.fcgi?blog_id=2&tag=Freshwater&limit=20">the Freshwater affair</a>, it could turn out to be a serious question.

<a href="http://www.accountabilityinthemedia.com/">Accountability in the Media</a> is a blog that comments mainly on local doings here in Knox County. Its author, a fundamentalist Christian, is a strong supporter of John Freshwater.  He regularly videotapes Board of Education meetings, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/mountvernon1805#g/u">has posted numerous videos</a> on Youtube.  (Those who are morbidly interested <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0v4lAEyg-c">can see me in one</a>.) 

In December 2011, <a href="http://www.accountabilityinthemedia.com/2011/12/freshwater-appeals-to-5th-district.html">Accountability wrote</a> about Freshwater's appeal of the decision of the Court of Common Pleas upholding Freshwater's termination.  As an aside in that post, Accountability published a photo of the Hogwarts coat of arms on a banner hanging in the middle school library where school board meetings are held, and captioned the photo<blockquote>(The Mount Vernon Board of Education met recently below a poster that could be interpreted as being of a religious nature: The Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry coat of arms.)</blockquote>I can't tell you how amusing it is to see a fundamentalist Christian implicitly equating the Bible with a work of fiction, and how much fun I'll have with that if the author of Accountability and his co-religionists push that notion. I suppose it's possible that Accountability was engaging in humor here, but given that there is a history of fundamentalist religious hysteria over Harry Potter (see, <i>e.g.</i>, <a href="http://www.christiananswers.net/q-eden/harrypotter.html">here</a> for an example and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_debates_over_the_Harry_Potter_series">here</a> for an overview), I wouldn't be amazed to learn that Accountability is serious.
