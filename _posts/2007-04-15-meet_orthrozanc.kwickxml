Simon Conway Morris and his colleague Jean-Bernard Caron published <url href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/315/5816/1255">a paper in <i>Science</i></url> on a new Cambrian fossil called <i>Orthrozanclus</i>.  The cool thing about the fossil is that it combines features from two other fossils that Conway Morris previously implicated as transitional stem groups between the modern crown groups ("phyla") of mollusks, annelids, and brachiopods: <url href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiwaxia"><i>Wiwaxia</i></url> and <url href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halkieria"><i>Halkeria</i></url>.  Of course, according to Discovery Institute propaganda, transitional fossils like this don't exist.

<url href="http://arstechnica.com/journals/science.ars/2007/3/1/7278">Here is a news summary</url>.  See also the <i>Orthrozanclus</i> post from PZ Myers, his <url href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/07/odontogriphus_omalus.php">post last year</url> on another stem group mollusk-ish critter, <i>Odontogriphus</i>.
