And the <a href="http://www.centerforinquiry.net">Center for Inquiry</a> provides a <a href="http://www.centerforinquiry.net/oncampus/darwin_day">short list of resources</a> for campus organizations or anyone else who wants to sponsor an event. In particular, you may contact their <a href="http://www.centerforinquiry.net/speakers/category/evolution_creationism_and_intelligent_design">speakers bureau</a> to find speakers on evolution, creationism, and intelligent-design creationism (it is a complete mystery why hardly anyone from Panda's Thumb is on that list, but we will not go into that now). Additionally, Center for Inquiry directs you to the <a href="http://www.darwinday.org/">International Darwin Day Foundation</a>, where you may find a list of activities near you, and, of course, the <a href="http://ncse.com/taking-action">National Center for Science Education</a>. 

CFI recommends that you try to teach someone about evolution or other scientific principles and notes that the Public Broadcasting System has a <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/index.html">wealth of material on evolution, science, and Darwin</a>. The <a href="http://evolution.berkeley.edu/">Understanding Evolution</a> Web page is likewise an excellent resource.

Finally, not mentioned by CFI, the Clergy Letter Project lists 400-odd <a href="http://www.theclergyletterproject.org/rel_evolution_weekend_2012.htm">religious congregations</a> that plan Evolution Weekend activities, February 10-12. Indeed, it may be of interest to some that <a href="http://www.umc.org/site/apps/nlnet/content3.aspx?c=lwL4KnN1LtH&b=5259669&ct=11563621">Science can help church keep its young folk</a>.
