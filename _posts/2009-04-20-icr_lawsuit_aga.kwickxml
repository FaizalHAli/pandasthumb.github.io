The Institute for Creation Research (ICR) has <a href="http://ncseweb.org/creationism/legal/institute-creation-research-graduate-school-v-paredes-et-al">filed a lawsuit</a> against the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board (THECB) for denying it authority to issue masters degrees in science education. The ICR, of course, is a young earth creationist outfit that recently moved to Texas from California. It's been running <a href="http://www.icr.org/icrgs/">what it calls a graduate school</a> for several years, issuing worthless pieces of paper that it calls advanced degrees in various sciences. Sadly, the ICR's "graduate school" was <em>officially accredited by a nationally recognized accreditation agency</em>--<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20031205173958/http://www.nexusjournal.org/2002judicial/dinosaurtracsRTP.htm">something I consider something of a scandal.</a> But when ICR moved, it <a href="http://www.tracs.org/files/DOE_Nov07.pdf">withdrew from that national accreditation</a> because it expected that it would get accreditation from the state of Texas. That turned out not to happen: THECB unanimously denied ICR's request for authority to grant degrees purporting to be scientific degrees.
