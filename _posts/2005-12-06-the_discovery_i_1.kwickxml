In responding to a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/04/weekinreview/04good.html">recent New York Times article</a> (already discussed in detail <a href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2005/12/the_scientific_1.html">here</a> and <a href="http://www.stcynic.com/blog/archives/2005/12/ny_times_on_ids_lack_of_accept.php">here</a>), the Discovery Institute's <a href="http://www.evolutionnews.org/2005/12/did_new_york_times_report_the.html">John West once again points</a> to the Discovery Institute's list of "<a href="http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&id=2640&program=CSC">peer-reviewed and peer-edited publications</a>" as evidence that the Discovery Institute really does do science. 

That document, like so much that the Discovery Institute puts out, does not paint an accurate picture of what is actually going on. The list has been available in one form or another for quite a while now, and individual entries on the list have been critiqued in a number of locations. I'm going to address the list as a whole here. I will briefly comment on some of the individual entries in the process, but I am not going to take the time to address all of them. For the most part, I will assume, FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT ONLY, that the articles are more or less what they claim to be.
