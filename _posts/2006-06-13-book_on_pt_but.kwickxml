The review speaks of "the PT boundary" and "the PT mass extinction", but, sadly for creationists, it is speaking not of the Panda's Thumb, but the Permian-Triassic boundary.  The PT mass extinction is the largest and most severe mass extinction recorded in the fossil record, and (unlike the KT boundary, due to a bolide impact), scientists have not reached consensus on what the the primary cause(s) were.  

Erwin's book is entitled <i>Extinction: How Life Nearly Ended 250 Million Years Ago</i>.  Check out the <url href="http://scienceblogs.com/grrlscientist/2006/06/extinction.php">review</url> and the <url href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0691005249/">book</url>.
