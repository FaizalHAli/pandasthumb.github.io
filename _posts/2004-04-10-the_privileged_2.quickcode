<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic_bias">Anthropic Bias</a>

<quote><b>Anthropic bias </b>is the bias arising when "your evidence is biased by observation selection effects," according to philosopher Nick Bostrom. </quote>

Relevancy: The definition of habitability includes an anthropic bias, similarly the definition of measurability includes an anthropic bias.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic_principle">Anthropic Principle</a>

<quote>
The anthropic principle in its most basic form states a truism: that any valid theory of the universe must be consistent with our existence as carbon-based human beings at this particular time and place in the universe. Attempts to apply this principle to develop scientific explanations in cosmology have led to some confusion and much controversy.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copernican_principle">Copernican Principle</a>

<quote>
The Copernican Principle is the philosophical statement that no "special" observers should be proposed. The term originated in the paradigm shift from the Aristotelian model of the heavens, which placed Earth at the center of the Solar system because it appears that everything revolved around Earth. Nicolaus Copernicus demonstrated that Earth is not, in fact, in the center of the system and the motion of the heavens can be explained without assuming that we are observing from a special position.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediocrity_principle">Mediocrity Principle</a>

[quote]
The mediocrity principle is a generalization of the Copernican principle to state that "no place in the universe is fundamentally different than any other place." It is primarily used in astronomy, where it can be considered a manifestation of Occam's Razor. It can be contrasted with the anthropic principle.
