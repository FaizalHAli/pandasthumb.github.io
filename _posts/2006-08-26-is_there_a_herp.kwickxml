Coturnix over at <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/">Blog Around the Clock</a> needs help.  His friend Kevin is doing a survey of herps in China and <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2006/08/is_there_a_herpetologist_in_th.php">can't identify a frog</a>.  (Snakes are his speciality.)  Can anyone here identify it?  Pictures of the unidentified species, along with some known ones, can be found <a href="http://s73.photobucket.com/albums/i233/China_Herping/confounding%20amphibian/">here</a>.
