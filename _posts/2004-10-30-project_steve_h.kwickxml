Last week <a href="http://www.ncseweb.org/article.asp?category=18">Project Steve</a>, the NCSE parody of the lists creationists and IDists are so fond of amassing, passed the 500 <a href=" http://www.ncseweb.org/resources/articles/meter.html">mark</a>.  Yes, 500 doctorate-bearing Steves, Stephens, Stevens, Stephanies, and Estebans have now signed a statement attesting to the strength of the theory of evolution, and rejecting ID as a pseudoscience.  "A growing number of Steves are questioning the notion of intelligent design and instead turning to a theory called <i>evolution</i> to explain the origin of species" remarked non-steve Glenn Branch of the National Center for Science Education (<a href=" http://www.ncseweb.org/">NCSE</a>).  When asked how he knew the number was in fact <i>growing</i> and not just a rhetorical ploy by propagandists, Branch responded, "The same way creationists claim their lists are growing.  A year and a half ago when we started Project Steve we had no Steves, and now we have 500.  You do the math."  When asked how he knew the <i>number</i> of Steves was increasing, he perplexed, "Are you serious?  I just told you."

So what's next for Project Steve?  In a word, merchandizing.  "Now that we've reached a number of this magnitude, we can start capitalizing on it" remarked Nick Matzke, also of the NCSE.  "We've already cut an endorsement deal with a major soft drink company.  I myself am fond of the name ‘Dr. Stever'.  You know, like Dr. Pepper, but with the word Steve inserted.  The problem is, friggin' Hawking keeps insisting on ‘Steven Up', which of course is just plain stupid.  However, I can't tell if he's being serious or not.  Damn that robot voice of his.  It sucks at irony."

For those who don't know the story, Project Steve began as a response to a <a href="http://www.reviewevolution.com/press/pressRelease_100Scientists.php">list</a> created by the Discovery Institute, which they dubbed, "A Scientific Dissent from Darwinism".  Not getting the joke, the DI <a href="http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&id=2114">still</a> touts that list as meaningful, even though it currently has 325 members, and has been in existence since September 2001, twice as long as Project Steve.  "The numbers of scientists who question Darwinism is a minority, but it is growing fast", stated Stephen Meyer, the lone Steve on the DI's original list of 100, when the list was first released.  Sure, the number of signatories on the DI list is <i>growing</i>, but the Project Steve list is growing <i>faster</i>.  Some math-oriented Steves might even suggest, over <i>twice</i> as fast.  

"A growing number of scientists around the world no longer believe that natural selection or chemistry, alone, can explain the origins of life, and while they are still a minority, they are a growing minority," said <a href=" http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&id=2114">Bruce Chapman</a>, president of Discovery Institute, 3 years later in April 2004, around the one year anniversary of Project Steve.  Yes, I realize that there are people out there with advanced degrees that object to evolution, but the number of <i>Steves</i> that support evolution is growing even faster.  What say you?

"A growing number of scientists challenge the evolutionary view and claim that biology is better understood as a product of intelligent design" stated <a href="http://www.tiede.fi/keskustelut/keskustelu.asp?mainpage=&mainskip=&id=1321841&alue=1">this</a> website for an ID conference to be held in October 2004 (i.e. this month).  Okay, I got it.  There are some people that like ID.  This is not in dispute, but the number of Steves that support evolution is even larger, and growing faster than the DI list, and Project Steve is limited to only about 1% of the population.  So what about all those Steves?

"In science, truth isn't determined by majority vote" said DI spokesman Mark Edwards in direct <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/299/5610/1181c">response</a> to Project Steve.  Jeez, I give up.  Okay, if that's the case, then why did you make your list in the first place?!  

"The more interesting question was whether any serious scientists reject a naturalistic conception of evolution..." Opined Bill Dembski.  "That it is now a known fact can be credited to Seattle's Discovery Institute, whose list of scientists questioning Darwinian evolution was the impetus for Project Steve."

Okay, I get it.  You just wanted to show that there were <i>some</i> scientists out there that question evolution.  Alright, fair enough, mission accomplished.  You know what else is an interesting question?  Are there any serious scientists who reject a naturalistic conception of evolution, and in addition, believe that life on Earth was created by a group of aliens called the Elohim, think human cloning is the doorway to immortality, and worship a <a href="http://www.rael.org/int/press_site/full_screen_photo/rael5.jpg">spacesuit-clad</a> French dude who calls himself Rael?  The answer to that question is the same as the answer to Dembski's, "Why yes Matt, there <a href="http://www.rael.org/english/index.html">are</a>."  Maybe we should start teaching Raelianism, since there are <i>some</i> scientists who support it.  Granted, the number of scientists that believe in the almighty Rael are far fewer than those that back ID (especially when you consider the fact that Raelians <i>are</i> IDists), but as Mark Edwards says, "truth isn't determined by majority vote."
