<p>As we are so often reminded by proponents of <a href="http://www.ncseweb.org/resources/articles/996_intelligent_design_not_accep_9_10_2002.asp">Intelligent Design</a> creationism, we contain molecular "machines" and "motors". They don't really explain how these motors came to be other than to foist the problem off on some invisible unspecified Designer, which is a poor way to do science&mdash;it's more of a way to make excuses to <i>not</i> do science.</p>

<p>Evolution, on the other hand, provides a useful framework for trying to address the problem of the origin of molecular motors. We have a theory&mdash;<a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/origins/outline.html#evidence">common descent</a>&mdash;that makes specific predictions&mdash;that there will be a <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/comdesc/CDhierarchy.html">nested hierarchy</a> of differences between motors in different species. Phylogenetic analysis of variations between species allows us to reconstruct the history of a molecule with far more specificity than "Sometime <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/johnson.html">between 6,000 and 4 billion years ago</a>, a <a href="http://skepdic.com/intelligentdesign.html">god or aliens</a> (or aliens created by a god) conjured this molecule into existence by unknown and unknowable means".</p>

<p>Richards and Cavalier-Smith (2005) have applied tested biological techniques to a specific motor molecule, <a href="http://www.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/myosin/myosin.html">myosin</a>, and have used that information to assemble a picture of the phylogenetic history of eukaryotes.</p>
