<img src="http://komodo.procombel.be/images/dragon.jpg" vspace="5" hspace="5" place="left"/> Carl Zimmer has a post today about <url href="http://www.corante.com/loom/archives/2005/11/21/which_came_first_the_snake_or_the_venom.php">the work of Dr. Bryan Grieg Fry</url> on the evolution of snake venom.  If that name sounds familiar to those of you who aren't reptile specialists, you may have run across Dr. Fry's <url href="http://www.venomdoc.com/">homepage</url>, or you may have seen his research profiled previously on Panda's Thumb <url href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/pt-archives/000946.html">here</url>, or you may have read comments by the good doc <url href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2005/11/in_the_its_so_s.html#comment-54890">in this thread.</url>  Zimmer, as always, has an excellent overview of Fry <i>et al</i>'s new paper in Nature (<url href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/nature04328.html">link </url>), but he didn't emphasize the one sneak peek I received from Bryan.  So, I thought I'd add a bit to Carl's overview.
