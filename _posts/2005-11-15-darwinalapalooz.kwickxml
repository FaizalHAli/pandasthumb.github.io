Many have long known and loved the website <url href="http://pages.britishlibrary.net/charles.darwin/">The writings of Charles Darwin on the web</url> run by John van Wyhe, at the British Library, which has virtually all of Darwin's <url href="http://pages.britishlibrary.net/charles.darwin2/texts.html">published books and articles</url> online (yes, Virginia, Darwin wrote over <url href="http://pages.britishlibrary.net/charles.darwin2/texts.html#periodicals">100 articles</url> in addition to <url href="http://pages.britishlibrary.net/charles.darwin2/texts.html#periodicals">all his books</url>).  And, less well known but very useful, all the volumes of <i>The Correspondance of Charles Darwin</i> are <url href="http://print.google.com/print?q=The+Correspondence+of+Charles+Darwin&btnG=Search+Print&hl=en">searchable at Google Print</url>.

Now, as <url href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0030382">reviewed by Niles Eldredge</url> in <i>PLoS Biology</i> [1], we have online Darwin's early notebooks -- the "Red" and "Transmutation" notebooks -- and manuscripts: the 1842 <i>Sketch</i>, the 1844 <i>Essay</i>, and the massive unpublished book for which <i>Origin of Species</i> was the "abstract", <i>Natural Selection</i>.  The website is <url href="http://darwinlibrary.amnh.org/">The Darwin Digital Library of Evolution</url> at the American Natural History Museum (<a href="http://darwinlibrary.amnh.org">http://darwinlibrary.amnh.org</a>).

1. Eldredge, N. 2005. "<url href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0030382">Darwin's Other Books: 'Red' and 'Transmutation' Notebooks, 'Sketch,' 'Essay,' and Natural Selection</url>." <i>Public Library of Science: Biology</i>, 3(11): e382. November 15, 2005.

PS: Hmm, the <i>PLoS: Biology</i> article says that the "Red" and "Transmutation" notebooks are online at the website, but I can't find them. Post a think if you find them.
