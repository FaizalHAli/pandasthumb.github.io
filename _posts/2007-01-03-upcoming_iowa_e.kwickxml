It's a new year, and it will be a busy one here in Iowa when it comes to evolutionary biology.  I want to highlight two upcoming events:  Iowa City's first annual <a href="http://www.iowacitydarwinday.org/">Darwin Day celebration</a> featuring a lecture by <a href="http://www.genotypebyenvironment.org/">Massimo Pigliucci</a>, and an upcoming <a href="http://spurr.pls.uni.edu/eid/Site/Home.html">symposium on evolution and intelligent design,</a> featuring John Haught and Wesley Elsberry.  These events will be held in February and March, respectively; more information on both of them can be found over at <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aetiology/2007/01/upcoming_iowa_events.php#more">Aetiology.</a>  Hope to see some readers there!
