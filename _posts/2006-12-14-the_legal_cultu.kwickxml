Larry Moran has <a href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2006/12/lessons-from-culture-wars.html">a long post here</a> reflecting on <a href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/12/weekend_at_behe.html">the DI's portrayal of Judge Jones as a plagiarist.</a> At first, Moran felt that Jones had really done something wrong, but he appears to have taken to heart the explanations <a href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/12/is_john_west_di.html">here </a>and <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/dispatches/2006/12/fisking_the_dis_study_on_the_d.php">elsewhere</a> that judges are <em>expected </em>to follow the proposed findings of fact of the party whom they find most convincing. It seems like a simple, innocent misunderstanding. But Moran goes on to make comments that seem like criticisms of the legal culture's standards of ethics and "standards of brilliance," that I think deserve some discussion.
