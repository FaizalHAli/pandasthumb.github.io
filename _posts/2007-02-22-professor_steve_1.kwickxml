<img src="http://i165.photobucket.com/albums/u57/aetiology/DSCN1867.jpg" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left"/>  Greetings again!

I've just returned from the <a href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2007/02/prof_steve_stev_4.html">annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science</a> (AAAS for you acronymophiles) in San Francisco.  What a city!  I mean, sure, I hang out here a lot with the <a href="http://www.natcenscied.org/">NCSE folks</a>, but I rarely have a chance to schmooze with other scientists of my caliber from out of town.  I mean, not that anyone I met has <a href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2005/03/project_steve_s.html">quite my qualifications</a>, but I had a lot of fun meeting people (including the hottie in the picture) and, of course, hearing more about evolutionary biology in the meantime.   Read all about it over at <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aetiology/2007/02/prof_steve_steve_does_aaas_1.php">Aetiology</a>.
