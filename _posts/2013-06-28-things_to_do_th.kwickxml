As a public service, here are a few suggestions on how to entertain yourself this weekend, and support science education at the same time!
If you are in the New Mexico area, come out the the annual meeting of the Coalition for Excellence in Science and Math Education (<a href="http://www.cese.org"><strong>CESE</strong></a>), which is hosting Louisiana's spunky young <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zack_Kopplin"><strong>Zack Kopplin</strong></a> (now a student at Rice in Houston).  Time: 1:00 PM Saturday, June 29th. Place: Room 122, Northrop Hall, on the UNM campus. There is a <a href="http://www.cese.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/unm_northrop.jpg">map</a> and a <a href="http://www.cese.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/zack-flyer.pdf">flyer</a>. Zack's topic is "Why we need a Second Giant Leap."

Secondly, you can act on Genie Scott's suggestion to support the excellent indie film "The Revisionaries" by voting for it at the PBS website. Genie writes "I know which one I'm voting for: The Revisionaries -- the film about Don McLeroy and the Texas Board of Education. I give it 5 stars. It's so well done and deserves to win." Vote <a href="http://www.pbs.org/independentlens/award/"><strong>here</strong></a>. 

Finally, here's a petition at the White House to Ban Creationism and Intelligent Design in the science classroom as federal law. As my cousin wrote me offline, there's a fat chance such a law will ever pass, but if the petition gets 100,000 signatures, Obama will have to publically address the request.It's about a third of the way there, but the July 15th deadline looms.  If you're so inclined, add your voice to the petition <a href="https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/ban-creationism-and-intelligent-design-science-classroom-federal-law/pNY6mCBg"><strong>here</strong></a>
