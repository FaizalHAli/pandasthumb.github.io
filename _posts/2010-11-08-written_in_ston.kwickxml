Some years ago I began following the blog of an undergraduate at Rutgers who split his posts between descriptions of work in paleontology and his problems getting a major put together in his preferred field of study.  Over the years it has been a real pleasure to watch as Brian Switek, the author of Laelaps (<a href="http://laelaps.wordpress.com/">first on Wordpress</a>, later <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/laelaps/">ScienceBlogs</a> and finally on <a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/laelaps">Wired's network</a>) grew as an up and coming science writer and as a person.

Brian's first book, <a href="http://www.blpbooks.org/books/writteninstone.html">Written in Stone: Evolution, the Fossil Record, and our Place in Nature</a> is coming out on December 1, and <a href="http://ncse.com/files/pub/evolution/Excerpt--writteninstone.pdf">NCSE has an excerpt</a>.  Sadly, it's not (yet?) available for my Nook (or for the Kindle) so I guess I'll have to wait a while to read the whole book.
