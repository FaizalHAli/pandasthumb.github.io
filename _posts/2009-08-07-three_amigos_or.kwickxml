We report (well really, <a href="http://blog.jmlynch.org/2009/08/07/three-yec-amigos-join-the-biologic-institute/">John Lynch</a> and <a href="http://dododreams.blogspot.com/2009/08/pros-from-dover.html">John Pieret</a> report), you decide.

The <a href="http://www.biologicinstitute.org/">Biologic Institute</a> is the research arm of the Disco 'Tute, promising (but not yet delivering) cutting edge intelligent design research.  Until now the Institute has been mainly the bailiwick of <a href="http://biologicinstitute.org/people/">Douglas Axe and a supporting cast</a> of American ID proponents.  Now, however, <a href="http://biologicinstitute.org/2009/08/06/new-talent-from-new-places/#more-47">three new additions from overseas</a> have been added to the Institute's roster.

What's delicious fun is that they're all Young Earth Creationists.

The question at issue is whether <a href="http://blog.jmlynch.org/2009/08/07/three-yec-amigos-join-the-biologic-institute/">Lynch's <i>Three Amigos</i></a> motif or <a href="http://dododreams.blogspot.com/2009/08/pros-from-dover.html">Pieret's <i>Three Stooges</i></a> motif is most appropriate.  Cast your vote in the comments.
