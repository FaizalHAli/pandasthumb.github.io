Dover</i> website.  Almost all of the post-trial filings, responses, etc., are now online in the <url href="http://www2.ncseweb.org/kvd/index.php?path=all_legal%2Fpost-trial/">post-trial directory</url> or the <url href="http://www2.ncseweb.org/kvd/index.php?path=all_legal%2Famicus/">amicus directory</url>.  The shortest and sweetest filing is probably the <url href="http://www2.ncseweb.org/kvd/all_legal/amicus/2005-12-07_Plaintiffs_response_to_FTE-DI_amicus.pdf">Plaintiffs' Response to the <i>amicus</i> briefs</url> (PDF) of the Discovery Institute and the Foundation for Thought and Ethics.  I quote the good bits <url href="http://www2.ncseweb.org/wp/?p=90">here</url>.

Also, on the <url href="http://www.ncseweb.org/">NCSE front page</url> there is <url href="http://www.ncseweb.org/resources/news/2005/PA/793_new_yorker_on_kitzmiller_case_12_12_2005.asp">a summary of Margaret Talbot's excellent long review</url> of the trial published in last week's <i>New Yorker</i>.  The drawing at left is the preview graphic for the full-page drawing that accompanies the print article; it depicts plaintiffs attorney Eric Rothschild cross-examining the star ID witness, Michael Behe.  As the caption put it, Behe was cross-examined "with cheerful mercilessness."  I imagine that one will be going on Eric's door.
