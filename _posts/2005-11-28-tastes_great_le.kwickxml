<img src="http://www.thetick.ws/images/tonguetongue.jpg" place="left" />A few months back, <url href="http://www.nature.com/nature/focus/chimpgenome/index.html"><i>Nature</i> published a series of papers on the completion of the chimpanzee genome</url>, including a <url href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v437/n7055/full/nature04072.html">massive comparison of the human and chimp genomes</url> (<url href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v437/n7055/full/nature04072.html">free online</url>).  One of the major utilities of having two closely-related genomes to compare (in addition to showing that humans and chimps have close common ancestors, as in Ken Miller's <url href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/dover/day1am2.html#day1am431">testimony on Day 1</url> of the <url href="http://www2.ncseweb.org/wp/"><i>Kitzmiller v. Dover</i> trial</url>) is that genes that are evolving rapidly under natural selection can be detected.  

At the time, an odd observation stuck in my head: not only were things like immune system genes evolving rapidly (as they do in apparently all mammals studied thus far -- it's a war zone out there with the microbes), but according to <url href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v437/n7055/fig_tab/nature04072_T4.html">Table 4</url> of the <i>Nature</i> article, so were some olfactory and taste receptor genes.  This seemed rather odd, given that humans are not exactly first among the beasts when it comes to sniffing capabilities, or, I presume, tasting (although according to <url href="http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/101/41/14830">this <i>PNAS</i> article</url>, our "gustatory receptors" are doing rather better than our olfactory receptors, <url href="http://www.genome.org/cgi/content/full/15/2/224">many of which have become pseudogenes</url>).

Even with our modest capabilities in this area, however, there are evidently some pretty important things that at least our taste receptors can do.  Protect humans from malaria, for example.  <url href="http://www.corante.com/loom/archives/2005/11/28/the_mosquito_and_the_bottle.php">Read Carl Zimmer's latest to find out how</url>.

<b>Note:</b> (I take a personal interest in this, because while in Zambia at the age of 7, I caught chloroquine-resistant malaria, even though I took my nasty, bitter chloroquine tablets every week.  I was quite ill for a month (I was not diagnosed until I was back in the U.S. for some time, where malaria is not exactly the first diagnosis that comes to the mind of the typical doctor).  So it was never quite "<url href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=mozclient&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&q=evolution+schmevolution">Evolution Schmevolution</url>" for me.)

<b>Yet one last note:</b> If you're wondering what that red thing is up at the front of the post, read about the episode of the cartoon <i><url href="http://www.thetick.ws/">The Tick</url></i> entitled "<url href="http://www.thetick.ws/car34.html">The Tick vs. Science</url>", and focus on the mad  scientist Dr. Mung Mung and his creation, <url href="http://home.jps.net/~lsnyder/24_tick.html">Tongue Tongue</url>.
