Carl Zimmer reviews A Flock of Dodos, and also brings up that worrisome issue, the image of scientists in this country. Cosmic Variance is talking about image, too. Scientists get called "inarticulate", "high-handed", "stiff" and "arrogant". "Arrogant" is terribly unfair as a criticism---a bit of arrogance is a virtue, and is exactly what you need in someone who is going to stick his neck out...and the creationists from Gish to Behe have possessed a superabundance of arrogance themselves.</quote></li>
<li>Scientist Wednesday, <url href="http://www.the-scientist.com/blog/display/23124/">Victories and Warnings for Evolution</url>, Brendan Maher<quote>From the reviews and the short preview I saw on the web a while back, it has the style and flair of a Michael Moore piece -- approaching sources with a friendly honest tone, but leaving them on camera just long enough to hang themselves. Indeed, this tactic works both ways, and the caricature of scientists he paints apparently places them in the ivory tower a bit. The characterization has stirred up some dust amongst scientist bloggers. Inarticulate and high-handed, their descriptions of real science can't compete with IDers slick presentation of nonsense. Perhaps that explains the polls that say most Ohioans still want "controversy" in the curricula. ID is off most scientist's radar, and if it doesn't help one's career to be able to explain science simply, many mightn't bother, contends PZ Myers of Pharyngula.
