Flew is of interest to PT readers in part because of his supposed conversion to deism a few years ago. You may find a detailed obituary <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/books-obituaries/7586929/Professor-Antony-Flew.html">here</a>. The National Center for Science Education has also run a brief obituary <a href="http://ncse.com/news/2010/04/antony-flew-dies-005438">here</a>. 

We covered Flew's conversion to deism <a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2004/12/antony-flews-co.html">here</a>, with an update <a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2005/01/antony-flews-co-1.html">here</a>.  Flew was an influential philosopher and was an atheist for the bulk of his career. His essay <a href="http://people.brandeis.edu/~teuber/phil06paptop1.html">Theology and Falsification</a> was widely read and translated into 40 languages. You may see my take on it <a href="http://www.secularhumanism.org/library/exclusive/young_01-05.htm">here</a>. The paper is also available <a href="http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/antony_flew/theologyandfalsification.html">here</a>, with an introduction by Flew, but without the discussion with R. M. Hare. 

In later years, evidently influenced by Gerald Schroeder and the intelligent-design creationists, Flew "converted" to deism and was badly misused by creationists. He later admitted that Mr. Schroeder had "mistaught" him, but he continued to believe that life could not have begun without some intelligent or purposeful creator.

According to NCSE, Flew published 2 monographs on evolution, but they say that these works were "arguably marred by a fondness for claims of genetic linkage between intelligence and race." I do not know anything about these monographs and so will not comment further. I will remember Flew for the essay in which he showed just how foolish it is not just to believe without evidence, but more, to prop up your belief with untestable speculations.
