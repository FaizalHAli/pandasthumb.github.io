<img align="left" src="http://my.sota-oh.com/~rbh/pics/sazure1.jpg"/>Having recently (finally!) acquired a digital camera with pretty good zoom capabilities (10x optical, 3x electronic), I've been lurking around the place taking pics of little things, pushing the zoom to the max.  This is my favorite so far, what I think is a <i>Celastrina</i> of some variety/subspecies, though the notched wing is a teaser.  (Is there a lepidopterist in the house?)  I'm particularly taken with the pattern of alternating black and white on the antennae.
