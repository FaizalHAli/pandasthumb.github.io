Over at <url href="http://www.darwincentral.org">Darwin Central</url>, some impressively-obsessed blogger has <url href="http://www.darwincentral.org/blog/2006/06/02/pied-pipers-at-the-gates-of-dawn/">attempted to rate 50 creationist websites</url> on their propensity to use commonly-mined quotes.  Methods: (1) start with the quotes in the <url href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/quotes/mine/project.html">Talkorigins.org Quote-Mine Project</url>; (2) search for those quotes on the creationist websites; (3) somehow put it all in a relational database; (4) tabulate.

The winner, with 75 of the 158 quotes listed at Talkorigins, was <url href="http://www.anointed-one.net/">Anointed-one.net/</url>.  It is followed by a couple of sites that are primarily creationist quote-mine collections (studying the evolution of such collections would be an interesting project).  <url href="http://www.answersingenesis.org/">Answers in Genesis</url> (#9), the <url href="http://www.icr.org/">ICR website</url> (#8), and <url href="http://www.harunyahya.com/">Harun Yahya</url> (#5)  make the top ten list, but the famous Velikovskian <url href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/teds-world.html">Ted</url> <url href="http://www.ediacara.org/ted.html">Holden</url>, aka <url href="http://www.talkorigins.org/origins/jargon/jargonfile_i.html">The Inimitable One</url>, beats them all with his website <url href="http://www.bearfabrique.org/">bearfabrique.org</url> (#4).  The <url href="http://www.discovery.org/">Discovery Institute</url> comes out at a disappointing #30, but there is a lot of competition out there, and they spend a lot of their time trying to dumb down the education of U.S. children.

All in all, this is a rather impressive effort, and another example of the kind of "creoinformatics" that the web and modern technology makes possible.
