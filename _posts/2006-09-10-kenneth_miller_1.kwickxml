The recent entries on PT, one by <url href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/09/ken_miller_at_k.html"> PZ Myers</url>, and the other by <url href=" http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/09/ken_millers_tal.html">Jack Krebs</url>  have invoked a heated exchange of views, wherein many comments manifest strong feelings, either blaming Miller (as PZ's essay does) for redirecting the critique from evolution to atheists, or exonerating him as a valiant fighter for evolution (as comments by Nick Matzke on <url href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/09/ken_miller_creationist.php"><Faringula</url> blog do). In view of that exchange, I would like to point to a detailed analysis of Miller's two-prong position as it is evinced in his popular book <i>Finding Darwin's God</i>. This analysis can be seen in an essay at <url href="http://www.talkreason.org/articles/Yin.cfm">Talk Reason</url>
