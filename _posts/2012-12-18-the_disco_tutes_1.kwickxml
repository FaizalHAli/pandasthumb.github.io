This deserves its own post. Yesterday <a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2012/12/if-they-both-be.html">I pointed</a> to a <a href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2012/12/ann-gauger-describes-intelligent-design.html">post at Larry Moran's Sandwalk</a> about a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tuZIxDxkxI">Discovery Institute video</a> showing Ann Gauger, a "researcher" at the Disco 'Tute's BioLogic Institute, in which she mangles phylogenetics and population genetics. Commenters on Youtube and both Sandwalk and here have identified the laboratory in which Gauger was supposedly speaking. It is <a href="http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-862039/stock-photo-biological-science-laboratory-at-night.html">a stock photograph</a> from a commercial photo site. It's a <a href="http://www.mediacollege.com/video/special-effects/green-screen/">green screen job</a>, which is a peculiarly appropriate method by which to present the DI's pseudoscience. Fake lab, fake science.

Can we say "pathetic"?
