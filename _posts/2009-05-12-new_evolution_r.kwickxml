There is a wide array of resources on the web about evolution, ranging from public access to technical papers available via <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=pubmed">PubMed</a> to the excellent <a href="http://evolution.berkeley.edu/">Understanding Evolution</a> site operated by the University of California Museum of Paleontology and the National Center for Science Education.  The grand daddy of them all, of course, is the <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/">TalkOrigins Archive</a>.

Now a new resource has been established by T. Ryan Gregory, evolutionary biologist and blogger at <a href="http://genomicron.blogspot.com/">Genemicron</a>.  It's called <a href="http://www.evolverzone.com/">Evolver Zone</a>, and is "a resource for students, teachers, and researchers with an interest in evolution."

Evolver Zone is a collection of a wide range of resources on evolution, from <a href="http://www.evolverzone.com/?cat=193">online databases</a> to <a href="http://www.evolverzone.com/?cat=11">software</a> to <a href="http://www.evolverzone.com/?cat=15">teaching resources</a> to <a href="http://www.evolverzone.com/?cat=4">multimedia</a> (including games!).  I haven't browsed the whole site yet, but what I've seen looks to be very useful, particularly for advanced high school and undergraduate classes.  Gregory tells us the site is a work in progress, so check back often for new additions.
