<img src="http://www.thelutheran.org/images/photo/06october/jones.jpg" place="left" />Today the magazine <i>The Lutheran</i> has made its <a href="http://www.thelutheran.org/article/article.cfm?article_id=6096">interview</a> with Judge Jones <url href="http://www.thelutheran.org/article/article.cfm?article_id=6096">freely available</url> on its website.  October's <url href="http://www.thelutheran.org/article/issue.cfm?issue=132">cover story</url> is on science and religion, and includes a <url href="http://www.thelutheran.org/article/issue.cfm?issue=132">series of stories</url> on the Lutheran perspective on the evolution/creationism issue.  My parents get <i>The Lutheran</i>, so now my strange job has landed in their mailbox.  There is no escape!

The Jones interview is notable for including some details on Jones's experience in becoming a judge -- quite an involved process -- and on his religious upbringing, which has not been treated in depth elsewhere.  We also get some more on his views on the relationship between the judiciary and politics, which Jones has made into a bit of a personal quest following the post-decision claim that Jones had "stabbed in the back" his political allies.
