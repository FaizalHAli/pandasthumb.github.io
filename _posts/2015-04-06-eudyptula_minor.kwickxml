<big><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_penguin"><i>Eudyptula Minor</i></a> -- little penguin, Kangaroo Island, Australia. These penguins are nocturnal, but are apparently <a href="http://www.kipenguincentre.com.au/penguin-tours.php">blind to the red light</a>. Unfortunately, according to <a href="http://www.kipenguincentre.com.au/">Kangaroo Island Penguin Center</a>, "Our nocturnal Penguin Tours ceased in November 2013 due to the very low numbers of Penguins in the Kingscote colony. Predation by the increasing numbers of New Zealand Fur Seals from 2010 onwards has decimated the Penguin Colony, because the seals kill the adult penguins as they swim ashore at night to feed their chicks and therefore the chicks also die. We apologise for this, but the situation has been beyond our control."</big>
