<url href="http://www.frif.com/new2004/pro.html"><img place="center" src="http://www.frif.com/new2004/gifs/pro.gif" /></url>Perhaps in some kind of cosmic penance for <i>Slate</i> editor Jacob Weisberg's <url href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=mozclient&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&q=site:www.pandasthumb.org+weisberg">fight-starting</url> <url href="http://slate.msn.com/id/2124297/">editorial</url>, today the <i>Slate</i> "medical examiner" desk has an <url href="http://www.slate.com/id/2124625/">excellent slide-show essay on Haeckel</url> that actually gives a reasonably balanced overview of Ernst Haeckel, his science and art, and his legacy.  The essay appears to be provoked by a showing of the <url href="http://www.frif.com/new2004/pro.html">new award-winning documentary <i>Proteus</i></url>, about Haeckel and the scientific and artistic "discovery" of the under-sea, invertebrate world.  I haven't seen the movie yet, but we are about due for a correction of the all-too-common Haeckel-was-pure-evil narrative that is very common among both evolutionists and creationists.  On the other hand, part of the problem with Haeckel was that he tended to mix the science and the artistic, imaginative, metaphysical vision a bit too much, and from the looks of it <i>Proteus</i> may do this too.  On the <i>other</i> other hand, all great science popularizations seem to have a pretty strong imaginative vision tied to the dry scientific facts, so mixing the two may be intrinsic to the work of the science popularizer.  If this is so, then the thing to do is for readers to simply be alert to what science popularizers are doing, and mentally separate the two aspects of the work so that each can be considered on its own merits.
