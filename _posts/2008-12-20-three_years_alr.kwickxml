Can you believe it's been three years since <url href="http://ncseweb.org/resources/kitzmiller">Judge Jones issued a devastating anti-"Intelligent Design" ruling</url>?

Ah, the memories of Kitzmas past.  Remember <url href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2005/12/waterloo-in-dov.html">"Waterloo in Dover"</url>? <url href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2005/11/missing-link-cd.html">"Cdesign proponentsists."</url>?  The <url href="http://www.pamd.uscourts.gov/kitzmiller/kitzmiller_342.pdf">"breathtaking inanity of the Board's decision"</url>?

Even though the Creationist Choir says that Kitzmiller v. Dover is <url href="http://sensuouscurmudgeon.wordpress.com/2008/12/20/three-years-since-dover-merry-kitzmas/">"No big deal"</url>, it's obvious they're still smarting over their wounds.

Anyway, "Intelligent Design" is so yesterday.  Everyone knows <url href="http://www.nmsr.org/stork.htm"><b>Strengths and Weaknesses</b></url> is the Big New Thing.

<b>Merry Kitzmas, everyone!</b>
