<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Bettany">Paul Bettany</a>, who plays Charles Darwin in <a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/09/eugenie-scott-r.html">Creation</a>, is also playing the archangel Michael in the upcoming supernatural fantasy movie, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legion_%28film%29">Legion</a>.  According to the <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/sony_pictures/legion/">trailers</a>, Michael comes to Earth to save humanity from the God's wrath.

I hope I'm not the only one who finds this pairing of roles amusing.
