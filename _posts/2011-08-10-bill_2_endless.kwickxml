BILL the second is "<a href="http://youtu.be/Ncgm9QOzQsA">Endless Forms Most Beautiful</a>," by Sean Carroll. (Not the <a href="http://preposterousuniverse.com/">cosmologist</a> or the biologist <a href="http://pages.uoregon.edu/joet/people/people2.html">formerly in Joe Thornton's lab</a> and <a href="http://www.oeb.harvard.edu/faculty/marx/marxlabFrameset.htm">currently at Harvard</a>, but the <a href="http://www.molbio.wisc.edu/carroll/index.html">evo-devo thinker</a> who is <a href="http://www.hhmi.org/about/carroll.html">Vice President for Science Education at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute</a> [HHMI].) Carroll's talk is the first in a <a href="http://www.hhmi.org/biointeractive/evolution/lectures.html">four-part series on evolution</a>, the 2005 Holiday Lectures sponsored by HHMI. The <a href="http://www.hhmi.org/biointeractive/hl/">Holiday Lectures</a> are probably an exaptation of <a href="http://www.rigb.org/contentControl?id=00000001882&action=displayContent">The Royal Institution Christmas Lectures</a> that gave us our <a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2011/07/bill-1-the-ultr.html">inaugural BILL</a>.

Here are some things to look for and think about:
<ul>
	<li>An extensive historical account of Darwin's thought, including some questions about the reactions of his family.</li>
	<li>An emphasis on the fossil record.</li>
	<li>A very interesting choice of an experimental study to illustrate natural selection: <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/100/9/5268.full">coat color in pocket mice</a>. Why interesting? It's the work of <a href="http://www.oeb.harvard.edu/faculty/hoekstra/">Hopi Hoekstra</a>, coauthor of a <a href="http://www.oeb.harvard.edu/faculty/hoekstra/PDFs/HoekstraCoyne2007.pdf">harsh critique of evo-devo</a> that started a <a href="http://www.oeb.harvard.edu/faculty/hoekstra/Commentaries/2008_Science_adapt.pdf">quaint little scientific dustup</a>. (The article and dustup were a couple years after the lecture. More at <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/04/coyne_and_wray_at_the_oregon_s.php">Pharyngula</a>.)</li>
	<li>Some simple math to show the reasonableness of evolutionary change over actual time scales.</li>
	<li>Good questions from the audience, about how the mutations got there in the first place and whether the changes are a "coincidence."</li>
</ul>

The lecture begins and ends with comments by Tom Cech. If you just want Carroll's talk, start at about 4:00, and skip to 6:50 if you don't want the intro video on Carroll's background. And there's a transcript <a href="http://www.hhmi.org/biointeractive/dvd/transcripts/Evolution%20Lecture%201%20Transcript.pdf">here</a>.
