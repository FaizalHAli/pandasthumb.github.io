Recently various blog sites have commented on the involvement of the Foundation for Thought and Ethics with the Dover lawsuit.

I would like to discuss various findings

Although FTE claims to be publishing science books, it obviously has a religious agenda. Buell refers to FTE as a "Christian think-tank" in the original application for tax-exempt status. FTE's articles of incorporation state that its purpose is both religious and educational, and it includes "proclaiming, publishing, preaching [and] teaching...the Christian Gospel and understanding of the Bible and the light it sheds on the academic and social issues of the day." The application referred to says the organization's first activity would be the editing of a book "showing the scientific evidence for creation."</quote>

<quote>
The exclusive teaching of evolution is a major force of modern naturalism which, if not checked, will remove every trace of theistic thought from the public sector. Therefore, we should recognize that even if we are not individually interested in the origins question, the creation issue touches us all. The exclusive teaching of evolution ushers in moral relativism and inclines young minds toward naturalistic religions. But a call for censorship is not appropriate. Instead, the emphasis in our efforts to counter the naturalistic indoctrination in the public schools and public sector should be to restore balance in the free expression of ideas. Let us remember that Jesus also told us to be "wise as serpents but innocent as doves."

<a href="http://www.au.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&id=7192&abbr=cs_">Science Test</a> at the Americans United for the separation of Church and State.

<quote> Despite what national ID proponents say, Americans United and the ACLU insist that the religious underpinnings of ID in Dover are obvious. They point out that Of Pandas and People is published by a religious organization. The Texas-based group, the Foundation for Thought and Ethics, originally described its mission was "proclaiming, publishing, preaching [and] teaching...the ChrisÂ­tian Gospel and understanding of the Bible and the light it sheds on the academic and social issues of the day."

 The Foundation is less upfront about its goals these days. In keeping with the trend to attempt to secularize ID, the group's website (www.fteonline.com) gives little indication that the organization is religious. The online mission statement is now much more benign sounding, reading in part, "The Foundation for Thought and Ethics is working to restore the freedom to know to young people in the classroom, especially in matters of worldview, morality, and conscience, and to return the right of informed consent to families in the education of their children."

The Foundation was more forthcoming in 2002 on its Form 990, a document the Internal Revenue Service requires all non-profit groups to file annually. There, the Foundation listed its mission as "Promoting & publishing textbooks presenting a Christian perspective of academic studies." </quote>

WHAT FTE IS ABOUT

Foundation for Thought and Ethics (FTE) is working to restore the freedom to know to young people in the classroom, especially in matters of worldview, morality, and conscience, and to return the right of informed consent to families in the education of their children.

 

To do this, FTE has organized several influential scientific symposia, produced major publishing breakthroughs on the subject of origins, helped to inspire the robust and exciting international movement of Intelligent Design, and launched an enriching series of high school textbooks now used in both public and private schools.

[...]

How you can pray for us:

 

Â·        Now that we have hired a seasoned textbook marketing specialist to expand our nationwide impact of textbooks in schools, pray the Lord will open doors of opportunity with just the right contacts to get these books into the public schools.

Â·        Pray that we will locate in each state an independent representative of God's choosing to work with FTE in promoting the textbooks.

Â·        Pray for open hearts and minds of school administrators to receive these books.

 

Thank you again for standing with us.  You are so important to our team effort!

 

Sincerely, in Christ,

Jon Buell

They accomplish this through publishing books and sponsoring conferences. Jon's book, Of Pandas and People, is <b>a Christian view on the evolution vs. creation debate.</b>
