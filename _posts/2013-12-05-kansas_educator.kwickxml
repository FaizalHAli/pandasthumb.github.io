A couple months ago, <a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2013/09/creationists-su.html">Richard Hoppe</a> and <a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2013/10/a-right-not-to.html">I blogged</a> about the lawsuit brought by a creationist group against the state of Kansas, alleging that teaching real science to students violates the First Amendment by "indoctrinating" them with ideas that might make them question their religious training. State officials today filed <a href="http://ncse.com/files/2013-12-05_Ds_Motion_to_Dismiss.pdf">a motion to dismiss</a> that lawsuit, which you can read here. It's a very strong motion--the most important parts are pages 28-43--so I don't have much to add. Kansas is clearly in the right and deserves easily to win this motion. <a href="http://ncse.com/news/2013/12/kansas-answers-cope-0015221">More at the NCSE's site.</a>
