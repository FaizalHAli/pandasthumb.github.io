This is perhaps slightly off-topic, but we have not heard from the neo-Confederate and one-time secessionist <a href="http://americanloons.blogspot.com/2014/05/1022-michael-peroutka.html">Michael Peroutka</a> in a long time, not since he <a href=https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2014/05/dinosaur-fossil.html>donated a dinosaur fossil to the Creation "Museum"</a> or <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2014/11/michael-peroutk.html">was elected to the Anne Arundel County Council in Maryland</a>. According to an <a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/politics/bs-md-pol-peroutka-ag-20220202-x6lcsbwfynaordddshodb7tlt4-story.html">article</a> by Pamela Wood in yesterday's  <i>Baltimore Sun</i>, he now plans a run for Attorney General of Maryland. As we noted in 2014,
<blockquote>â€¦ Michael Peroutka until recently was also a board member of the League of the South, a white supremacist, neo-Confederate and pro-secessionist organization that has been <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/league-south">named a hate group</a> by the Southern Poverty Law Center. </blockquote>

Let us hope that the citizens of Maryland show more discernment than the citizens of Anne Arundel County.
