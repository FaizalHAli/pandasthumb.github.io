<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morpho"><i>Morpho peleides</i></a> &ndash; an old morpho butterfly sits out its final days in a local butterfly house. The iridescent blue color is not due to pigment, but is rather a structural color caused by wave interference of light that is reflected from the scales on the upper wing surface.
