Eric Hedin is a physicist who was ordered to stop teaching intelligent-design creationism at Ball State University, as we reported <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2016/05/intelligent-des-1.html">here</a> several years ago. Far from being canceled, Prof. Hedin was promoted to Associate Professor and, I assume, granted tenure. He nevertheless left Ball State for Biola "University," formerly Bible Institute of Los Angeles. 

According to Jerry Coyne, <a href="https://whyevolutionistrue.com/2022/05/07/eric-hedin-beefs-about-being-canceled-at-ball-state-by-the-ffrf-and-me-but-forgives-me-showing-a-cat-leading-me-to-jesus/">Eric Hedin beefs about being “canceled” at Ball State by the FFRF and me, but forgives me, showing a cat leading me to Jesus!</a>. I incline to agree with Prof. Coyne: Prof. Hedin was by no means canceled; he was <i>promoted</i> for Chrissake! At any rate, Prof. Hedin has now written a book published by the Discovery Institute, presumably because no real publisher would touch it. His video, Canceled Science, may be found <a href="https://youtu.be/TA4QutvxX88">here</a>. I have not watched it yet, but I promise to do so when I return home and comment if I think it is appropriate. 

Meanwhile, I suggest that you enjoy Prof. Coyne's article.
