100 meters underground in the Victoria Mine, Ely, Nevada. The small but extremely high-grade copper ore body is made up of copper minerals:  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azurite">azurite</a> [2CuCO<sub>3</sub>·Cu(OH)<sub>2</sub>] (dark blue),  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malachite">malachite</a> [CuCO<sub>3</sub>·Cu(OH)<sub>2</sub>] (green),  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysocolla">chrysocolla</a> [(Cu,Al)<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>(OH)<sub>4</sub>·n(H<sub>2</sub>O)] (blue-green), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chalcopyrite">chalcopyrite</a> [CuFeS<sub>2</sub>] (golden yellow), as well as several other non-copper minerals like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrite">iron pyrite</a> [FeS<sub>2</sub>] (pale brass-yellow).  While spectacular and very high-grade (about 16&nbsp;% Cu),  the ore body is difficult to mine due to its depth, small size and weak structure.
