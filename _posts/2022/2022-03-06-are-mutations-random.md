_I was hoping to write this post a week ago, but war intervened,
and I spent much of the time since then watching news about
the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, the incredible courage
of large numbers of Ukrainians who are resisting it, and the
incredible courage of those Russians who are protesting their
government's aggression. This post takes a short break from
that._

Two months ago, an article in _Nature_ argued, from observations
on the plant _Arabidopsis thaliana_ that mutation is not
random.  This was the occasion for loud declarations from
creationists and ID advocates that the foundations of the
Modern Synthesis had been undermined.

* Here is [the _Nature_ paper, which is open access](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04269-6)
* and here are the responses [at the Discovery Institute's site _Evolution News and Science Today_](https://evolutionnews.org/2022/02/new-study-in-nature-showing-non-random-mutation-spells-trouble-for-neo-darwinism/)
* and similar [commentary from the "peanut gallery"](https://uncommondescent.com/intelligent-design/are-mutations-really-random/) at Uncommon Descent
* and the (short) [thread at Peaceful Science](https://discourse.peacefulscience.org/t/mutation-bias-reflects-natural-selection-in-arabidopsis-thaliana/14724)

What I would like to ask is, whether modern evolutionary theory,
rests on the assumption that mutation is "random".  And if so,
in what sense does it need to be random for the theory to be
tenable?  I'll make some suggestions below, but they are 
tentative, and your thoughts are welcome.

Some questions:

<ol>
<li>Is there evidence that the mixture of mutations that happen
shifts in response to environmental changes, in such a way that
among those mutations that do occur, a larger fraction of them
are adaptive in those environments?

For example, when one could have mutations that helped the organism
adapt to higher temperatures, do more of those mutations show up?  And when the temperatures are getting colder, do the mutations
that occur become more likely to help adaptation to lower temperatures and less likely to help adaptation to high temperatures?  I
don't know of any evidence that shifts like this happen.</li>

<li>Does modern evolutionary biology have as a fundamental
tenet that mutation rates in all parts of the genome are equal
and that mutations that change bases are equally
likely to result in each of the other three possible bases?

There, the answer is clearly no, since many models of base
substitutions in neutral mutation have for a long time allowed
for mutation rates to differ in different parts of the genome,
and for the pattern of changes to depart from simple symmetrical
models such as the Jukes-Cantor model.  This includes allowing
models of regional mutation rate variation, such as Hidden
Markov Models.</li>
