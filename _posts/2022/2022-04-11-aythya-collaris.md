<figcaption><a href="https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Ring-necked_Duck/overview">Aythya collaris</a> &ndash; ring-necked duck, Goose Creek, Boulder, Colorado, February, 2022. This bird seemed to be dabbling alongside a pair of mallards. All About Birds (see link) tells us that the ringed neck may be useless as an identifying mark; 19th century biologists named the species using dead specimens.
