<figcaption><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_stink_bug">Chinavia hilaris</a> &ndash; green stink bug, Boulder, Colorado, April, 2022. My ever alert granddaughter Alex captured this picture using a small, handheld computer that she calls her "phone." She has promised to watch for any changes in the eggs, but neither of us has any idea what the hatchlings are going to eat; the eggs are normally planted on the underside of a leaf.
