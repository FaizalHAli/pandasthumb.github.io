Longtime PT posters Andrea Bottaro, Matt Inlay, and I have just published a <url href="http://www.nature.com/ni/journal/v7/n5/abs/ni0506-433.html">"Commentary" essay in May 2006 issue of <i>Nature Immunology</i></url>. <b>(Update: Subscription <u>no longer</u> required.  Thanks to <i>NI</i>.)</b>  See the <url href="http://www.ncseweb.org/resources/news/2006/ZZ/968_immunology_in_the_spotlight_at_4_21_2006.asp">NCSE announcement</url> and <url href="http://www2.ncseweb.org/wp/?p=124">more background</url> at the <url href="http://www2.ncseweb.org/wp/">NCSE Evolution Education and the Law</url> website.

The article is:

Therein, we review the now-notorious episode in the <i>Kitzmiller</i> case where, during Eric Rothschild's dissection of Michael Behe, Rothschild <url href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/dover/day12pm.html">challenged</url> Behe's claims about the scientific literature on the evolutionary origin of the immune system by piling up on Behe's podium a stack of books and articles on the evolution of the immune system.  Behe responded that he had not read most of it, but dismissed it out of hand, and this cavalier attitude seems to have been one (of many) factors that impressed Judge Jones and persuaded him to issue the <url href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/dover/kitzmiller_v_dover.html">thorough, detailed ruling</url> that he did.

The article also reviews two sets of events that led up to this courtroom confrontation: first, the publication of various important pieces of evidence for the transposon model for the origin of rearranging antibodies in the immune system.  Second, the article also reviews previous internet encounters between ID advocates and the immunology evidence, for example  with Matt Inlay's TalkDesign article <url href="http://www.talkdesign.org/faqs/Evolving_Immunity.html">Evolving Immunity</url>, or Andrea Bottaro's PT posts "<url href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/pt-archives/001081.html">The Revenge of Calvin and Hobbes</url>" and "<url href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/pt-archives/001108.html">Behe's meaningless complexity</url>."  All of these helped me realize just how vulnerable Behe was on the immune system, and this led to the assembly of a collection of articles and books on the topic; this impressed Eric Rothschild, and the rest is history.

If you are disappointed that you don't have a subscription to <i>Nature Immunology</i>, never fear, the <url href="http://www2.ncseweb.org/kvd/exhibits/immune/index.html">Supplementary Material</url>, containing a list of the publications used in the case, is online in the exhibits folder of NCSE's <url href="http://www2.ncseweb.org/kvd/">online <i>Kitzmiller</i> archive</url>.  Also online are two webpages I have put together: first, an <url href="http://www2.ncseweb.org/kvd/exhibits/immune/immune_evo_annotated_bib.html">Annotated Bibliography on the Evolution of the Immune System</url> that is meant to show people some of what is actually in these articles, and just how remarkable the evidence is and how even more remarkable it is that the ID movement has been able to snow so many people for so long.  Second, a <url href="http://www2.ncseweb.org/kvd/exhibits/immune/immune_evo_bib_long.html">longer, unannotated bibliography</url> shows that even the 60+ articles and books in the Annotated Bibliography are just a fraction of what is available in the libraries on this topic -- 342 references are included in the longer bibliography, and some simple statistical descriptions are also included.  I do take some time to point out the implications for some of Behe's claims.

We are quite tickled that this story -- and it is a great story -- was interesting enough to the editors of <i>Nature Immunology</i> to be published.  We felt it was important to let the immunology community know that someone is calling the pseudoscientists to account, and that the immunology community's hard work over many decades cannot be forever ignored by the ID movement.
