I missed this earlier, but T. Ryan Gregory <a href="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com/2009/12/evolution-education-and-outreach-vol-2-issue-4/">reminds us</a> that the new issue of <i>Evolution: Education and Outreach</i> is now online.  There's a broad range of articles and reviews in the issue, and one stands out for me.  It's Douglas Allchin's article on <a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/d74701167h424u0k/?p=de0426fae91b46668d3cdf097249f0e2&pi=3">resources for teaching the evolution of morality</a>.  All the articles are linked from Gregory's post <a href="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com/2009/12/evolution-education-and-outreach-vol-2-issue-4/">here</a>.  I heartily commend it to your attention.  That journal is a valuable resource for us all.
