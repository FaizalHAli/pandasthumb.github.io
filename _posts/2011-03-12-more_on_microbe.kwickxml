Over at <a href="http://leilabattison.wordpress.com/">Science in Pen and Ink</a> Lelia Battison has an <a href="http://leilabattison.wordpress.com/2011/03/11/microbes-on-a-moonbeam-disentangling-the-meteorite-microbe-claims/">in-depth discussion</a> of Richard Hoovers' paper on alleged "fossil" bacteria in CI1 Carbonaceous Meteorites in the <a href="http://journalofcosmology.com/Life100.html">Journal of Cosmology</a>. It is an excellent article that covers a lot of issues not previously covered, and brings together some other information that has been scattered around. I'm referenced as well. Go have a read of <a href="http://leilabattison.wordpress.com/2011/03/11/microbes-on-a-moonbeam-disentangling-the-meteorite-microbe-claims/">Microbes on a Moonbeam, disentangling the Meteorite  Microbe claims</a>.
