My article “Reason And Common Ground: A Response to the Creationists’ ‘Neutrality’ Argument” will appear in the next issue of the <a href="http://www.chapman.edu/LawReview/"><em>Chapman Law Review</em>,</a> which subscribers should receive in the mail in a week or so. <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1088905">You can download it on SSRN.</a> The article is a reply to <a href="http://agaperevolution.files.wordpress.com/2007/09/trask_esi_clr.pdf">a creationist article</a> that the <em>Chapman Law Review </em>published last year, entitled “Evolution, Science, And Ideology: Why The Establishment Clause Requires Neutrality in Science Classes,” by Stephen W. Trask.
