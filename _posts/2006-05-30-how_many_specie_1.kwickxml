One of the questions asked in the comments of <a href="http://thequestionableauthority.blogspot.com/2006/05/how-many-species.html">the previous post in this series</a> is quite pointed, and very much on topic for this discussion, so I'm going to take a minute or two to answer it. I'll give the answer to the example in another post, that will shortly follow this one. <a href="http://thequestionableauthority.blogspot.com/2006/05/how-many-species.html#114877080699058496">Karl asked</a>: <blockquote>So why are you asking that question? How is "species" defined. Does it really have a definition? Does it matter? Isn't "species" just a modern reaction to the biblical term "kinds"</blockquote>Now that I've taken a few minutes to think about it, I'm starting to remember why I was dodging that question. I could write a long, rambling discourse on the topic, but in all honesty the best I can do for a definition of "species" is to paraphrase Justice Stewart's concurring opinion in <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&vol=378&amp;invol=184">Jacobellis v. Ohio</a>: I might not ever be able to intelligently define the term, but I know it when I see it.
