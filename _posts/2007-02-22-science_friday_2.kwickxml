Tomorrow, <url href="http://www.sciencefriday.com/pages/2007/Feb/hour2_022307.html">Talk of the Nation/Science Friday is doing a show</url> with Edward Humes, author of <i>Monkey Girl</i> (<url href="http://monkeygirlaudio.blogspot.com/2007/02/monkey-girl-friday.html">blog</url>, <url href="http://www.edwardhumes.com/books/monkey-girl/">website</url>), Randy Olson, director of <url href="http://www.flockofdodos.com/"><i>Flock of Dodos</i></url>, and yours truly, author of this spiffy blogpost.

We are in the second hour, so it should be on from 12-1 Pacific time.  Apart from the radio, NPR is streamed live from many websites, and the Talk of the Nation archived shows are put online a few hours later.
