The paper <a href="http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/8/4/609.full">Selective bird predation on the peppered moth: the last experiment of Michael Majerus</a> is one of the most downloaded and cited articles in <i>Biology Letters</i> in 2012.  As Bruce Grant, one of the coauthors, said to me privately, "It is encouraging that the <i>Biston</i> evidence, presented by those of us who actually know it, is being widely read." <i>Biston</i> is the genus of the peppered moth, <i>B. betularia</i>.

PT has covered a controversy concerning the peppered moth <a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2005/03/why-the-peppere.html">here</a>.  <a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/01/mike-majerus-pa.html">Michael Majerus</a>, a lepidopterist and expert on melanism and the peppered moth, died suddenly and unexpectedly in 2009.   Nick Matzke covered Majerus's last experiment <a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2012/02/selective-bird.html">here</a>.
