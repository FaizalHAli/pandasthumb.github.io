<a href="http://echothis.info/V0"><img src="http://austringer.net/images/pss/pss_freeze_me_320h.gif" align="left" /></a>The marketing people at <a href="http://www.quarkexpeditions.com/">Quark Expeditions</a> have <a href="http://www.blogyourwaytoantarctica.com/blogs">a contest going to send a blogger</a> on one of their Antarctic expeditions next year. They will send a blogger along simply based on votes, a straight-up popularity contest. This seems like an opportunity that I shouldn't miss. I'm eager to compare my sartorial style with the resident penguin colonies down there, and I'm sure that dodging crabeater or Weddell seals should simply add a certain zest to the adventure for someone of my diminutive stature.

We're still discussing which one of us gets smuggled along in the luggage. I've told him that that is what duffel bags are <em>for</em>. Wesley makes for a pretty good Sherpa, what with his interdisciplinary background in <a href="http://www.onlinezoologists.com/cs/node/21">marine biology</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0805815619">computer science</a>. He's also <a href="http://baywing.net/phot">handy with a camera</a> and acoustics gear, and does <a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/author/wesley-r-elsberry/">some wicked blogging</a> <a href="http://austringer.net/wp/">himself</a>. Of course, it's not a patch on my own set of qualifications, including the B. Amboo Chair in Creatoinformatics at the University of Ediacara, a J.D.-M.D.-quintuple Ph.D., and being a seven-time Nobel nominee. As the Izaak Walton of information theory and the Ulysses S. Grant of drinking contests, I can recognize talent for myself and exploit it. Sorry, the new word is <em>collaboration</em>, isn't it? We did well working together at the 2005 <em>Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District</em> trial, and I'm looking forward to some more, er, collaboration in the cold.

<a href="http://echothis.info/V0"><img src="http://pandasthumb.org/images/pss/pss_freeze_me_badge_88x31.gif" align="right" /></a> So, <a href="http://echothis.info/V0">Freeze Me, Please!</a> Voting runs through September 30th, so please pass this on. Here's an 88x31 pixel badge you can use by copying the code below:
