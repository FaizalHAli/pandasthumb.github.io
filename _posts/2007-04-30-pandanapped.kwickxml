After having dinner with <a href="http://www.alexfoundation.org/">Dr. Irene Pepperberg</a>, Prof. Steve Steve was <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/retrospectacle/2007/04/dinner_with_irene_pepperberg_a_1.php">pandanapped </a> by a man in a top hat.  Perhaps one of those intelligent-design activists at Telic Thoughts, who recently accused the professor of being <a href="http://telicthoughts.com/pandas-thumb-and-hexley-the-hoaxing-platypus/">a panda puppet</a>.  They seem to be more familiar with him than they should be.

I know it would mean a lot to Prof. Steve Steve if you friended him on <a href="http://www.myspace.com/profstevesteve">Myspace</a> or joined his fan club on <a href="http://uga.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2368100595">Facebook</a>.

Shelley Batts (who based on her pictures alone seems to be both irresponsible and avian-friendly) is trying desperately to get him back.  <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/retrospectacle/2007/04/dinner_with_irene_pepperberg_a_1.php">She needs your support</a>.
