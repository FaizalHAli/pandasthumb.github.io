<p>Jeffrey Shallit <a href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2007/01/j_scott_turner.html">has already replied</a> to this <a href="http://chronicle.com/weekly/v53/i20/20b02001.htm">deeply silly</a> opinion piece from biologist J. Scott Turner.  But there is so much inanity in Turner's piece that I couldn't resist <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/evolutionblog/2007/01/fisking_turner.php">taking a shot at it</a> myself.  A subscription is required to read the essay online, but I think I've quoted enough of it to give you a pretty good idea.  Comments can be left over at EvolutinBlog.  Enjoy! </p>
