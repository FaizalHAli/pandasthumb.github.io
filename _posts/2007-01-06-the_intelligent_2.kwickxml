On Uncommon Descent the <url href="http://www.uncommondescent.com/archives/1928">following quote can be found</url>. Note only the quote but the comments show the scientific vacuity of Intelligent Design in all its g[l]ory

<quote author="Davescot">Imagine, if you will, how a wasp evolved the ability to perform brain surgery complete with a drug that turns a cockroach into a docile zombie it can lead around like a dog on a leash. I emphasize the word imagine because any story you come up with is a work of fiction. Such fiction is the basis of the Theory of Evolution.</quote>

Davescot is correct that 'fiction' is the basis of the theory of evolution. Every explanation starts with a 'story' which is then supported or contradicted by further research.

Of course, one may very well ask: How does Davescot intend to explain the behavior of the wasp? Was it intelligently designed? After all, most ID activists would claim evolutionary ignorance as evidence of intelligent design. And if intelligent design is the answer then what does this story tell us about the designer? Does he have a fondness for wasps? A dislike for cockroaches? An interest in torturing cock roaches? Perhaps we can take some of these examples of 'intelligent design' and explore what the designer may have looked like? 

Why should we even accept the validity of a design inference which is purely based on our ignorance about how something happened?

Larry Arnhart responded to Davescot, having noted the 'any story you come up with is a work of fiction": 

<quote author="Larry Arnhart">Imagine, if you will, how a wasp was intelligently designed with the ability to perform brain surgery complete with a drug that turns a cockroach into a docile zombie it can lead around like a dog on a leash. I emphasize the word "imagine" because any story you come up with is a work of fiction. Such fiction is the basis of the Theory of Intelligent Design.</quote>

Sadly enough, Davescot seems to not 'get it'. Behavior modification is a common approach found amongst parasites. And in many cases the parasites are specialized towards a single host. Unless one imagines one or more intelligent designers teaching this behavior to the many parasites, or implant the information in the parasites' genomes, a much more credible explanation is to pursue a more natural explanation. In addition, as Davescot points out, such an arms race would inevitably involve a 'response' from the affected host species, unless selection pressures are too small. 

Now that Intelligent Design's scientific vacuity has once again been exposed, it is time to return to to real science sites like <url href="http://scienceblogs.com/loom/2006/02/02/the_wisdom_of_parasites.php">Carl Zimmer's</url> which have discussed the Emerald Cockroach Wasp (Ampulex Compressa) a while ago and on Pandasthumb, <url href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/02/the_wisdom_of_p.html">I explored the implications of the wasp to intelligent design</url>.

<quote author="PvM">Seems the Ampulex makes for a better showcase of intelligent design than the Bacterial Flagella, although if ID activists are to believed, the Intelligent Designer somehow created what would later evolve into the Type III secretory system used by such pest as the bubonic plague. Talking about Divine retribution...</quote>

Science magazine's article <url href="http://sciencenow.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/2004/812/3?etoc">A Wasp With a Taste for Brain</url> describes the gory details of the parasitic wasp's behavior.

<img src="http://scienceblogs.com/loom/uploads/Ampulex%20emerging.jpg" />

On Carl Zimmer's site, Dr Gal Haspel, who has spent many years on researching the wasp, kindly provided some interesting details about the research, helping us understand what the evolutionary history of the wasp may look like. Remember that Davescot considers such stories, wishful thinking or 'fiction'.

<quote>The stinger evolved from an ovipositor. We know that because of anatomical and developmental evidence in this other wasps. This can give the worried anti-evolutionists an answer to "what was the first step for a stinger?" One can easily imagine an ancestor wasp, using its ovipositor to deposit eggs on dead or weak insects (as some existing species) evolving into a similar wasp that also uses the same ovipositor to inject some of its own neuro-active chemicals into a candidate prey and then evolving the dedicated stinger from the ovipositor. On the other hand, one can choose not to imagine that.</quote>

Of course, ID proponents may refer to evolutionary 'fiction' but ID remains, as usual standing at the sidelines, reveling in ignorance. Once again ID is a science stopper while evolutionary 'fiction' leads to many new exciting hypotheses and research. Libersat's <url href="http://www.bgu.ac.il/life/Faculty/Libersat/publications.html">publications page</url> shows over a decade of cutting edge research leading to many interesting and fascinating discoveries about the wasp and its host.

Compare this with Davescot's "explanation"

<quote author="Davescot">Not only do the unguided naturalists have to ignore the virtually impossible causal chain of events random evolution requires to form the complex strategy of the wasp, they also have to somehow believe that the poor cockroach was denied a defense mechanism by the same process. It seems to me it would be far easier for a random mutation in the cockroach to foil the intricate wasp strategy than it would be for a random changes to restore the wasp strategy. The law of entropy (2nd law of thermodynamics) causes complexity to tend toward disintegration into simplicity. Intelligence is the only known quantity that can work so well against the natural tendency towards increasing entropy as to bring about the existence (at all) of things as complex as wasps and cockroaches in the first place.</quote>

Appeal to ignorance, a poorly executed appeal to the 2nd law of thermodynamics and unsupported assertions: And who still believes ID is not creationism in a thin disguise. If Davescot were truly interested in where the evidence leads, then surely he would be a supporter of the <url href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2004/09/validating_desi.html">Multiple Designer Theory</url> by Richard B. Hoppe.

The story of <url href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerald_cockroach_wasp">Ampulex Compressa</url> starts as early as 1942, when Williams described the behavior of a cockroach hunting wasp which had been introduced into Hawaii from New Caledonia.

Williams FX. 1942. <b>Ampulex compressa (Fabr.), a cockroach-hunting wasp introduced from New Caledonia into Hawaii</b>. <i>Proc Haw Entomol Soc</i> 11:221--233

<url href="http://morphbank.net/Browse/ByImage/index.php?keywords=&tsnKeywords=ampulex+compressa&spKeywords=&viewKeywords=body&localityKeywords=&listField1=imageId&orderAsc1=DESC&listField2=&orderAsc2=ASC&listField3=&orderAsc3=ASC&numPerPage=20&goTo=&resetOffset=&activeSubmit=2"><img src="http://morphbank4.scs.fsu.edu/images/thumbs/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/5/3/0/53077.jpg "/></url>

The wasp would sting its prey twice, once to temporarily immobilize the front legs of its prey and a second sting to the cockroach's brain which induces 30 minutes of intense grooming followed by a permanent lethargic stage with reduced escape responses. The wasp will then guide the host to a previously prepared den where an egg is carefully deposited onto the roach's abdomen. The den is then carefully sealed with pebbles. The egg hatches in about two days and the larva chews its way into the abdomen of the host. The larva carefully avoids eating essential organs until the larva reaches the cocoon stage.

The wasp is unique in two aspects: First the sting does not paralyze its prey permanently, and secondly this is the only documented example of a sting directly into the brain of the victim.

In 1983, Piek et al published a paper in "Entomologia Experimentalis et Applicata", describing the behavior of the Ampulex Compressa:

<quote>Abstract  The solitary wasp Ampulex compressa Fabr. (Sphecidae: Hymenoptera) stings the cockroach first in the thorax and then in the neck toward the suboesophageal ganglion. The first sting results in a short lasting and completely reversible paralysis. The second sting causes an irreversible change in the behaviour: undisturbed cockroaches seem to be lethargic, and if stimulated they are able to run with speeds that equal that of control animals.</quote>

The research and observations raised many questions which have been the source for <url href="http://www.bgu.ac.il/life/Faculty/Libersat/research_interests.html">fruitful research</url> spanning more than a decade.

<quote>
The wasp Ampulla compressa subdues its prey by injecting venom apparently directly into the central nervous system. While the vast majority of venomous insects produce paralysis in their prey, A. compressa  utilizes a unique biochemical strategy: behavioral modulation.  The inflicted prey animal is rendered unable to organize an escape sequence, but remains ambulatory and is subsequently led by the predator to a suitable oviposition location, where it serves as a nutritional source for the wasp's young.  It is hypothesized that the central nervous system of the prey animal loses its normal ability to activate modulatory circuits involved in behavioral arousal.  The first specific aim of our resarch is to describe the biochemical composition of A. compressa venom, and identify the component(s) - termed here "anti-arousal toxin(s)" (AAT) that are involved in behavioral modulation of prey. This objective is accomplished through a combination of liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry and protein sequencing.  Amino acid sequence information of candidate AATs will be used to construct primers for use in PCR-based amplification of nucleotide sequences for complete characterization of AAT primary molecular structure. Our second aim is to determine the venom'starget in the animal's CNS. We determine the location of venom injection and which neurons are affected by the venom. By examining the behavior and the physiology of stung animals, we are exploring the mechanism which controls the responsiveness of the neuronal escape circuitry. We also study the effects ofthe neurotoxin on membrane properties of identified neurons and on synaptic transmission between these neurons. Our third aim is to verify the identity of candidate AATs by their introduction into the central nervous system in vivo and in vitro. We will assess their ability to produce the previously described behavioral and physiological properties syndrome caused by the natural stinging sequence.  These include lack of the escape response, characterized by failure of appropriate stimuli to elicit normal escape responses in the prey and selective failure to recruit fast motoneuron circuitry.  Finally, the last specific aim is to determine the precise alterations in synaptic transmission and neuronal membrane properties that underly anti-arousal behavioral modification.  This objective is approached in part through electrophysiological analyses of pre-and postsynaptic responses to appropriate escape stimuli.  Changes in membrane properties are assayed by measurements of membrane resistance, excitability and relevant changes in ion channel properties.

Libersat, Pflueger <b>Monoamines and the Orchestration of Behavior</b> <i>BioScience</i>, Volume 54, Issue 1 (January 2004) pp. 17--25 

<quote>Animals possess a rich repertoire of behaviors, each generated by the orchestrated activity of assemblies of neurons. Neuromodulators, and particularly monoamines, have been found to play a role in the recruitment of such assemblies. The role of specific monoamines in the modulation of behavior has been particularly well studied using invertebrate animals as models. In these animals, the neuronal assemblies underlying a behavior often consist of fewer neurons than those in vertebrates, and in many cases the activity of specific neurons can be causally linked to the expression of a specific behavior. In this overview, we illustrate the concept of chemical orchestration of behavior, using well-studied models of how monoamines modulate complex and long-lasting behaviors in invertebrate animals.</quote>

<quote>Unlike other venomous predators, the parasitoid wasp Ampulex compressa incapacitates its prey, the cockroach Periplaneta americana, to provide a fresh food supply for its offspring. We first established that the wasp larval development, from egg laying to pupation, lasts about 8 days during which the cockroach must remain alive but immobile. To this end, the wasp injects a cocktail of neurotoxins to manipulate the behavior of the cockroach. The cocktail is injected directly into the head ganglia using biosensors located on the stinger. The head sting induces first 30 min of intense grooming followed by hypokinesia during which the cockroach is unable to generate an escape response. In addition, stung cockroaches survive longer, lose less water, and consume less oxygen. Dopamine contained in the venom appears to be responsible for inducing grooming behavior. For the hypokinesia, our hypothesis is that the injected venom affects neurons located in the head ganglia, which send descending tonic input to bioaminergic neurons. These, in turn, control the thoracic premotor circuitry for locomotion. We show that the activity of identified octopaminergic neurons from the thoracic ganglia is altered in stung animals. The alteration in the octopaminergic neurons' activity could be one of the mechanisms by which the venom modulates the escape circuit in the cockroach's central nervous system and metabolism in the peripheral system.</quote>

<quote>Abstract  
1. 	The wasp Ampulex compressa hunts cockroaches as food for her offspring. Stung cockroaches show little spontaneous movement although they are able to move. Wind stimuli to the cerci, which normally produce escape responses, are no longer effective in stung cockroaches. In the present paper, we have searched for neural correlates responsible for the impairment of the escape behavior by the venom.
2. 	In control cockroaches, a typical motor response in the coxal depressor muscle to wind or tactile stimuli consists of an initial burst of the fast and slow depressor motoneurons followed by rhythmic discharges. In stung cockroaches, both stimuli evoke only a burst in the slow but no discharge activity in the fast depressor neuron. Intracellular recordings from the fast depressor motoneuron in stung cockroaches demonstrate that it still receives synaptic input, though subthreshold, from thoracic interneurons associated with the wind mediated escape circuitry. Discharge activity of the slow motoneuron lacks the rhythmic bursting pattern characteristic for slow walking in control animals.
3. 	Yet, the venom affects neither the response of descending mechanosensitive giant interneurons to tactile stimuli nor the response of the abdominal giant interneurons to wind stimuli, both of which are known to excite the thoracic interneurons. The venom has also no effect on neuromuscular signal transmission.</quote>

<quote>The wasp Ampulex compressa injects a cocktail of neurotoxins into the brain of its cockroach prey to induce an enduring change in the execution of locomotory behaviors. Our hypothesis is that the venom injected into the brain indirectly alters the activity of monoaminergic neurons, thus changing the levels of monoamines that tune the central synapses of locomotory circuits. The purpose of the present investigation was to establish whether the venom alters the descending control, from the brain, of octopaminergic neurons in the thorax. This question was approached by recording the activity of specific identified octopaminergic neurons after removing the input from the brain or after a wasp sting into the brain. We show that the activity of these neurons is altered in stung and brainless animals. The spontaneous firing rate of these neurons in stung and brainless animals is approximately 20% that in control animals. Furthermore, we show that an identified octopamine neuron responds more weakly both to sensory stimuli and to direct injection of current in all treated groups. The alteration in the activity of octopamine neurons is likely to be part of the mechanism by which the wasp induces a change in the behavioral state of its prey and also affects its metabolism by reducing the potent glycolytic activator fructose 2,6-bisphosphate in leg muscle. To our knowledge, this is the first direct evidence of a change in electrical activity of specific monoaminergic neurons that can be so closely associated with a venom-induced change in behavioral state of a prey animal.</quote>

<b>Host-Handling Behavior: An Innate Component of Foraging Behavior in the Parasitoid Wasp Ampulex compressa</b>


<quote>The reproductive success of parasitoids depends on their ability to locate, select, and handle hosts quickly and efficiently. Learning has been shown to play a role in host finding and host choice, but the role of learning in the handling of hosts has received little attention. We tested whether the speed and accuracy of host handling improve with experience in the wasp Ampulex compressa. This parasitoid performs an elaborate behavioral sequence when parasitizing its host, the cockroach Periplaneta americana. We provide a quantitative description of the behavioral sequence, and show that: (a) the duration of the whole sequence, (b) the number of completed stages, and (c) the precision of an important stage in the handling sequence, host antennal cutting, are similar in inexperienced and experienced individuals. We discuss features of A. compressa's life history that may select for innate host handling.</quote>

Innate host handling. So how does science explain innate behavior? Again, science has uncovered <url href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/07/060728103827.htm">exquisite details</url> how such innate behavior is controlled.

<quote>The researchers report that the command hormone, called ecdysis-triggering hormone or ETH, activates discrete groups of brain peptide neurons in a stepwise manner, making the fruit fly perform a well-defined sequence of behaviors.</quote>

Scientists also have found innate behavior in <url href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2005/03/050321083933.htm">primates</url>

What is <url href="http://www.cals.ncsu.edu/course/ent425/tutorial/Behavior/index.html">'innate behavior'?</url>

<quote>Innate behavior is genetically programmed.  Individuals inherit a suite of behaviors (often called an ethogram) just as they inherit physical traits such as body color and wing venation.  In general, innate behaviors will always be:

         1. Heritable -- encoded in DNA and passed from generation to generation
         2. Intrinsic -- present in animals raised in isolation from others
         3. Stereotypic -- performed in the same way each time by each individual
         4. Inflexible -- not modified by development or experience
         5. Consummate -- fully developed or expressed at first performance </quote>

An interesting example of <url href="http://www.cals.ncsu.edu/course/ent425/tutorial/Behavior/sphex.html">innate behavior in the sand wasp</url> has been documented by Henri Fabre

<quote>"At the moment when the Sphex is making her domicilliary visit, I take the grasshopper left at the entrance to the dwelling and place it a few inches further away.  The Sphex comes up ... looks here and there in astonishment, and, seeing the game too far off, comes out of the hole to seize it and bring it back to its right place.  Having done this she goes down again, but alone."

"I play the same trick again, and the wasp has the same disappointment on her arrival at the entrance.  The victim is once more dragged to the hole, but the wasp always goes down alone."

"This goes on as long as my patience is not exhausted."

J. Henri FabrÃ©, from Souvenirs Entomologiques </quote>

<img alt="slide.001.jpg" place="right" src="http://www.pandasthumb.org/slide.001.jpg" width="50%" height="50%" />


Lorenz  and Timbergen spearheaded the experimental research into (innate) behavior with experiments illustrating innate as well as simple learning behaviors.

They found that animal behavior often involves a combination of learned behavior as well as genetically determined behaviors. In other words, both genetics as well as the environment affect behavior.

Simple cues in the animal's environment (sign stimuli) trigger Fixed Action Patterns (FAP's), and because of the genetic foundation of the programming, these FAP's are executed perfectly without any practice 

The graylag goose always retrieves an egg that has been bumped out of her nest in the same manner. 

1. This is a fixed action pattern
2. She carries this sequence to completion, even if the egg slips away during the process

Parasitoid wasp affects metabolism of cockroach host to favor food preservation for its offspring.

Haspel G, Gefen E, Ar A, Glusman JG, Libersat F.

<quote>Unlike predators, which immediately consume their prey, parasitoid wasps incapacitate their prey to provide a food supply for their offspring. We have examined the effects of the venom of the parasitoid wasp Ampulex compressa on the metabolism of its cockroach prey. This wasp stings into the brain of the cockroach causing hypokinesia. We first established that larval development, from egg laying to pupation, lasts about 8 days. During this period, the metabolism of the stung cockroach slows down, as measured by a decrease in oxygen consumption. Similar decreases in oxygen consumption occurred after pharmacologically induced paralysis or after removing descending input from the head ganglia by severing the neck connectives. However, neither of these two groups of cockroaches survived more than six days, while 90% of stung cockroaches survived at least this long. In addition, cockroaches with severed neck connectives lost significantly more body mass, mainly due to dehydration. Hence, the sting of A. compressa not only renders the cockroach prey helplessly submissive, but also changes its metabolism to sustain more nutrients for the developing larva. This metabolic manipulation is subtler than the complete removal of descending input from the head ganglia, since it leaves some physiological processes, such as water retention, intact.

So what is needed to explain the behavior of the Ampulex Compressa? A stinger, relevant toxins, innate behavior would go a long way. So let's just walk through a scenario in which 

<quote>[t]he stinger evolved from an ovipositor. We know that because of anatomical and developmental evidence in this other wasps. This can give the worried anti-evolutionists an answer to "what was the first step for a stinger?" One can easily imagine an ancestor wasp, using its ovipositor to deposit eggs on dead or weak insects (as some existing species) evolving into a similar wasp that also uses the same ovipositor to inject some of its own neuro-active chemicals into a candidate prey and then evolving the dedicated stinger from the ovipositor. On the other hand, one can choose not to imagine that.</quote>

Then there is the stinger and the sensory organs

As I wrote, this is an issue that is being investigated "as we speak" but I can share with you some of the preliminary results we got before I left the lab and some of what Ram presented in the meeting of the International Society for Neuroethology:

- Using SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy) we saw bumps and depressions that resemble sensory organs scattered all over the stinger.
- By cutting the tip of the stinger and dipping it in dye solution (a technique called backfilling) we were able to stain processes of neurons coming out of the stinger and into the wasp central nervous system.
- When the stinger was treated with liquid nitrogen to inactivate the sensory organs, the wasps would try to sting the head for a very long time (more than 15 minutes while normally it takes about 1 min).
- When Ram removed the brains of cockroaches (one can do that without killing them!), wasps would also sting the head for a very long time.
- It is possible to record electrical signals from the neurons coming out of the stinger and introduce the stinger with chemical, mechanical and electrical stimulations. This will have to be done many more times before anything can be said about it.

Wow, you can remove the brains of the cockroaches without killing them, I wonder how careful a 'neuro-surgeon' the wasp really has to be...

Combine this with the findings about the toxins and the evolution of innate behavior and we have a very credible story, certainly when compared the absent hypotheses of intelligent design.

So let's recap the evolutionary 'just so story'. Since there is no intelligent design explanation, we cannot compare it directly but we can compare it to the 'we have no idea' explanation, preferred by ID proponents.

There seem to be three essential components

1. The stinger: As I have pointed out elsewhere, the stinger has been shown to have evolved from the ovipositor system
2. The venom: Secretions are commonly associated with the ovipositor, for instance to attach the eggs, to signal using pheromones, or to lubricate the ovipositor to facilitate the depositing of eggs. 
3. The behavior: As I have shown, innate behavior can be controlled by chemicals, setting in motion very complex behaviors.

I wonder how many of these papers Davescot has read before he made his ill-founded comment about evolutionary explanations?

Of course, many of these explanations deserve more research, which is exactly my point. Evolutionary science leads to fruitful hypotheses and follow-up research, while ID has to wait for science to admit that they do not yet know the full details of a particular aspect of the hypothesis.


Correction: I mentioned that the second sting induced an irreversible condition. Gal Haspel reports that

<quote author="Gal Haspel">By the way, the lethargic state is reversible! In the lab we can take the cockroach away after it has been stung but not yet parasitized. Such a cockroach will gradually recover until within 3 weeks it will be indistinguishable from other (not stung) roaches.</quote>
