<p>A number of us had an exciting weekend. The <a href="http://www.secularstudents.org/">Secular Student Alliance</a> had their national conference this past Friday through Sunday, in Columbus, Ohio&hellip;a quick two hour drive from the infamous Creation "Museum" in Kentucky. So a field trip was hastily organized, which quickly grew and grew, until over 300 of us gathered before the doors of Ken Ham's very silly establishment and spent an afternoon prowling through the absurdities. We now have a fine collection of articles for you to read.</p> 

<ul>

<li><p>I've put together a long <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/08/the_creation_museum_1.php">summary of my impressions of the "museum"</a>. My impression is that I was greatly unimpressed.</p></li>

<li><p>I wasn't alone, obviously&mdash;so I've also assembled a <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/08/tales_of_the_300_more_accounts.php">collection of links to blog posts, Flickr photo sets, and YouTube videos</a>. It was a very productive weekend that generated a huge volume of critical articles.</p></li>

<li><p>We have a very nice <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/08/the_whole_experience.php">video of one group's experience going through the place</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>We managed to rouse the ire of Ken Ham, who wrote a few complaints and attempted defenses of his goofball palaces. <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/08/aig_is_angry_with_us_for_repor.php">Both</a> of his <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/08/i_think_we_successfully_poked.php">complaints</a> have been shot down &mdash; with the evidence we gathered on the trip.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>Of course, the real triumph of the whole big shindig was that I got to ride the triceratops with a saddle!</p>
