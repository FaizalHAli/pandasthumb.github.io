The New York Academy of Sciences provides us with <url href="http://www.nyas.org/publications/readersReport.asp?articleID=57">access to a talk</url> by Nobel Laureate Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard on how genes drive development, no need for unspecified 'Intelligent Designers', no need for miracles, just hard work by  scientists who are committed to discovering the details of how, what, when and so on. Compare this with how ID explains the development of the embryo.
