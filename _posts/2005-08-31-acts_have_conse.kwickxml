The recent Kansas creationist kangaroo court hearings on evolution run by three creationist members of the Kansas State Board of Education (see <url href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2005/05/waterloo_delayed_again.html"><b>here</b></url> and <url href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2005/05/the_dog_ate_my_homework.html"><b>here</b></url> for stories) and the <url href="http://www.kcfs.org/KsSciSt1999-2001/Fliers_articles/Localcontroland%20more.pdf"><b>previous (1999) debacle</b></url> in Kansas are having consquences for higher education in that state.  In <url href="http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2005/aug/30/within_science_circles/"><b>a story in the Lawrence Journal-World</b></url> the Provost of Kansas University said <blockquote>For the state to be portrayed repeatedly in the national press as being anti-science does damage to this university.  The frustration is you fight this reputation problem every step of the way.</blockquote>KU dropped three places in the most recent U.S. News & World Report rankings of universities.

Kathy Martin, one of the creationist members of the Kansas State BOE, pooh-poohed the issue, saying <blockquote>I feel most people could probably care less," she said. "I really don't think it's that big of a deal except in certain circles.</blockquote>"Certain circles" presumably refers to those who actually know something about the issue.

This is a wakeup call for Ohio, my principal concern.  Consider these events: <list>The recent discovery of <url href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/pt-archives/001127.html"><b>the scandal associated with Bryan Leonard's Ph.D.</b></url> candidacy at the Ohio State University</list><list> Ohio's so-called <url href="http://science2.marion.ohio-state.edu/ohioscience/Controversy_Guide.html"> <b>"Critical Analysis" model lesson plan</b></url> drawn straight from Jonathan Wells's trash science (= <i>Icons of Evolution</i>), and</list><list> Ohio's <url href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/LAW/08/18/ohio.governor.ap/"><b>ethically impaired</b></url> but politically powerful Governor <url href="http://science2.marion.ohio-state.edu/ohioscience/TaftBackedID.html"><b>pressuring the State BOE</b></url> to weaken the science standards, which allowed that lesson plan to be considered. </list>None of this bodes well for the Ohio State University.
