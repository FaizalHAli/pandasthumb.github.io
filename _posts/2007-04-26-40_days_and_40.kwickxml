I plan to write a review at some point, but let me say right now that Chapman's version of the Dover battle is <i>hilarious</i> and pretty much every participant gets boiled down to their essence in a witty one or two sentences from Chapman's pen.  I assume Chapman acquired this skill as a scriptwriter.  Anyway, to illustrate, here is yours truly on p. 53:

<quote>Matzke, by contrast, [specifically, by constrast with AU lawyer Richard Katskee, who "looked as if he had just stepped out of the pages of <i>GQ</i>"], was from Oakland, California, and usually looked as if he had just rolled out of bed.  The NCSE staffer initially assigned to the Dover flare-up, he now briefed the lawyers on the arcane ins and outs of science.  Bespectacles, in his thirties, he was tall and large and peered down at you with a look of beleaguered doubt, as if to say, "You're asking me this question about science, but you know and I know that you're not going to understand my answer, so, although I find this stuff fascinating, wouldn't you really rather go for a beer?"</quote>

True enough I'm afraid...
