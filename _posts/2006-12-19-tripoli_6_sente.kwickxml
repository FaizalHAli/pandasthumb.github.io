The 5 Bulgarian and 1 Palestinian health workers accused of having infected Lybian patients with the HIV virus were <url href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/africa/12/19/libya.aids.ap/index.html">found guilty and sentenced to death today in Tripoli</url>, despite international outcry and <url href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/12/libya_vs_evolut.html">molecular phylogenetic evidence demonstrating their innocence</url>.  As much as it is tempting to snarkily frame this as a court victory for anti-evolution forces, the situation is too serious.
