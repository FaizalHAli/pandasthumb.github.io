Happy Jason Lisle Day! Today is the second anniversary of the day when
Jason Lisle, director of what passes for research at ICR (Institute
for Creation Research), promised he would explain why his alleged
solution to the creationist "<b>Starlight Problem</b>" wasn't
<i>really </i>demolished by the math of Einstein's General
Relativity-- in spite of much proof to the contrary that had been
shoved right in his face. Lisle had whipped up a convoluted, technical
explanation for why Young Earth creationists [YECs] are right about
the universe being created only 6,000 years ago, even though we can
see galaxies that are millions of light years away, and their
starlight must have been traveling towards us for much longer than
6,000 years. Subsequently critics confronted Lisle with a handful of
different mathematical and observational arguments that refuted his
alleged solution to the Starlight Problem, which he calls "<b>ASC"</b>
[Anisotropic Synchrony Convention]-- one point being that his ASC
would in fact <i>require a gravitational field</i> that ought to be
observable, but isn't observed. In his only response, two years ago
today, Lisle promised to explain why we're all stupid and maths are
all wrong and his BLEEPy model actually rules.

Uh huh. Sure you will Jason. Two years later, we're still waiting. His
comment has no content beyond the usual creationist combination of
genetic fallacy plus ad hominem attack: ignore the math because it was
"<i><b>made by those who have not studied the topic"</b></i>-- as if
Lisle's toy model is so friggin' hard! (For other entertaining
examples of creationists who respond to the demolition of their faked
evidence and/or terrible math with the very mature, "<i>Wah, it don't
count because you're all ignorant of my genius, ignorant
ignorant!!</i>", without ever actually employing their superior
intellects to show what's wrong with the maths, you can peruse <a

<br />
So on Sept. 11 of this year and every year, let's celebrate not just
the genius of Dr. Jason Lisle of the ICR, but the genius of all the
YECs over the years who've said they could explain how starlight can
get here from galaxies millions of light years away in a mere 6,000
years-- all of whom subsequently crashed and burned, including Lisle,
as we'll see below.<br />
<br />
In this blog post, I'll review <b>the math that shows why Lisle's
model is dead, dead, dead</b>, and why his cosmogony is absurd on
several levels, because contradicts Lisle's assumptions. But first,
for your entertainment, let's review some previous, disastrous, failed
attempts by YECs to "solve" the starlight problem.<br />
<br />
<b>Background: Previous YEC Attempts to Solve the Starlight Problem</b><br />
<br />
The "Starlight Problem" has vexed Young Earth creationists for as long
as there have been Young Earth creationists. Simply put, the universe
cannot be 6,000 years old if we can see galaxies millions of light
years away, and if light travels at the speed of 186,000 miles per
second-- not unless God is tricking us with phony light shows in the
sky. Here are four dead proposals.<br />
<br />
1. <b><i>"Omphalos"</i>, aka <i>"Appearance of Age"</i>: the
Deceiver-God is tricking us with phony light shows in the sky that
didn't really come from stars</b>. You might think that this argument
is an evolutionist spoof of a creationist argument, but in fact it was
promoted for decades by none other the most famous creationist in
American history, <b>Henry Morris</b>, the "Godfather" of modern YEC,
author of the influential <i>The Genesis Flood</i> (1961), and founder
of the ICR where Jason Lisle now works<i>. </i>Morris never backed
down over several decades but aggressively defended the idea of
deceptive light shows in the sky, along with his ICR lieutenant and
"star debater", <b>Duane Gish</b>. These light shows must be extremely
complex and highly contrived by Deceiver-God, due to the complexity of
many observed astronomical events and structures. For example, from
time to time a supernova comes into the news, and astronomers can
detect both photons <i>and neutrinos</i> from the exploding star, and
in years afterward they observed the expansion of the gas and dust
clouds thrown off in a shell around it, e.g <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SN_1987A">SN 1987A</a> that
exploded in 1987. All fake, all an illusion, according to the ICR when
Morris and Gish were alive-- fake photons, fake neutrinos, fake dust,
fake clouds... if the object is more than 6,000 light years away. If
it's closer than that, it might be real. Some large astronomical
structures are light-years across and in principle could cross the
6,000 light-year boundary, a topic the YECs discreetly avoid
discussing, but in principle structures like large nebula could be
half real and half make-believe, like Fox News.<br />
<br />
Henry Morris used Deceiver-God to explain away both the starlight
problem and also <b>radiometric dating</b>: In <i>The Genesis
Flood</i> Morris said God just created rocks with a high ratio of
daughter isotopes to parent isotopes, making them appear old by
radiometric dating, because the Bible says "a thousand years is as a
day to the Lord." Morris never explained why God made deeper rocks
appear older than rocks near the surface, or why volcanic intrusions
appear younger than the strata they intrude into. In a <a
href="http://ncse.com/creationism/general/miller-morris-debate-1981">debate
against Ken Miller in 1981</a>, Morris defended his "fake photons"
argument for starlight but in a comical/pitiful performance, he seems
embarrassed by it. In the Q and A session afterward, an audience
member asks him, "[C]ould we not equally accept that the universe was
<i>created a millisecond ago with prepackaged memories of your
two-and-a-half-hour debate implanted in our minds?</i>" [a philosophy
called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omphalos_hypothesis#Last_Thursdayism"><b><i>Last
Thursdayism</i></b></a>]. Morris'<i><b> </b></i>1981 answer is still
amazing.<br />
<blockquote>
[Henry Morris]: <i>...obviously when you suggest the creator could
create things with the appearance of built-in memories... yes, in
principle of course as <b>the creator he could do that</b>, and <b>if
there is a creator then you can't say 'No.'</b> ...But when we suggest
that there is creation, then <b>the only way to say that there is no
possibility of creation with an appearance of maturity</b>, or
completeness or appearance of age, or whatever, is to say that
creation is impossible. And that's to say that there is no creator,
which<b> is tantamount to atheism</b>.</i> [<a
href="http://ncse.com/creationism/general/miller-morris-debate-1981">Henry
Morris vs. Ken Miller debate</a>, 1981]
</blockquote>
So you have to like Morris' Deceiver-God and his fake photons, fake
supernovae, fake nebulae, fake light shows in the sky, fake geological
evidence etc., or else you're an atheist. This is the classical
defense of Omphalos, still used by Jason Lisle today: <b>flip the
burden of proof</b> onto the other guy by demanding, "Where is your
evidence that my all-powerful God can't trick me?"<br />
<br />
2. <b>The Speed of Light is Slowing Down</b>. This terrible idea was
the go-to answer in the 1970's and 1980's.&nbsp; Do I have to say that
the method to "prove" this was a hoax, and that energy is converted
into mass by the equation <i>E = mc^2</i>, so when creationists say
that the speed of light <i>c</i> could have been, say, a hundred
million times (10^8) faster in the past, that means that the energy
released by nuclear fusion in stars would have been <b>ten quadrillion
times (</b>10^16) <b>greater </b>back in the old days and the universe
would blow up?  Likewise all the radioactive uranium,
thorium and radium in the whole Earth would release ten quadrillion
times more heat, and in your own body the fraction of your potassium
that  is radioactive would friggin' kill you. <br />
<br />
This dumb idea of light "tiring out" from its long journey was
concocted by <b>Norman and Setterfield </b>about 1969 and the method
behind it was thoroughly debunked by the time of the 1982 book
<i>Scientists Confront Creationism</i>. Norman and Setterfield took a
historical value of the speed of light and a then-current measurement,
then they drew a <i>curve through the the highest end of the error bar
of the first, to the the lowest end of the error bar of the
second</i>, and surprise!! The curve goes down over time!! And of
course they used an exponential curve, so if you go back in time a few
centuries, the
speed of light would be vastly, exponentially larger than now. Also,
al stars would explode, the Earth would vaporize and your own
potassium would kill you.<br />
<br />
This dumb idea was pushed by Flood fossil fraudster <b>"Dr." Carl
Baugh</b> (fake Ph.D.) and by "Dr." Kent Hovind (fake Ph.D.), aka
Federal Prisoner #06452-017. Naturally, <b>Ken Ham, Andrew Snelling
and Carl Wieland</b>, in a precursor to Answers in Genesis ministry,
pushed the idea in the 1990 edition of <i>The Answers Book</i> (pages
189-192).<br />
<br />
3. <b>Stars are Not Big and Very Far Away, They're Small and Close
Up.</b> Again, this is a real creationist argument, not a parody of
creationism.<br />
<blockquote>
[Carl Baugh]: <i>One of the concepts of evolutionary consideration is
that <b>some of the stars appear to be much closer. The formula which
calculates these distances is by no means proven.</b> But even if God
wanted them to be sixteen billion light years away, that's no problem
for an omnipotent... God.</i> ["Dr." Carl E. Baugh (fake Ph.D.),
'Panorama of Creation', (1992), p.11-13, 16, <a
href="http://www.biblestudymanuals.net/k02.htm">cited here</a>]
</blockquote>
Ooh, the jury is still out!! The stars might be fifty feet away and
just very tiny, who knows, scientists can't prove a damn thing!<br />
<br />
Henry Morris again, embarrassed to have to invoke this argument, but
invoking it anyway, because what the hell?
<br />
<blockquote>
[Henry Morris]: <i>... <b>we can't even be sure that these stars are
billions of light years away</b>. There're very sophisticated esoteric
sort of assumptions involved in calculating the distances. </i> [<a
href="http://ncse.com/creationism/general/miller-morris-debate-1981">Henry
Morris vs. Ken Miller debate</a>, 1981]&nbsp;&nbsp;</blockquote>
Ooh, them scientists are doin' long division and my head hurts! So
<i>esoteric!</i> No, scientists do have sophisticated methods to
estimate the distances to stars, and the laws of physics don't permit
the stars to be shiny nails pounded in the dome of heaven like the
Bible says. Here creationist <a
href="http://www.answersingenesis.org/articles/arj/v6/n1/astronomical-distance-light-travel-problem">Danny
Faulkner summarizes and disputes other creationists who claim stars
are small and close up</a>.<br />
<br />
4. <b>Space could be Riemannian, then light from the most distant
galaxies could get to us in 15 years! </b>BullBLEEP, and the people who
say it don' t even know what Riemannian means.&nbsp;  They just want
to use jargon. It means that space is curved in an invisible
dimension, but negatively curved, like a saddle. Well, that would have
observable effects, and they're not seen. So this is a toy model of a
<i>hypothetical </i>universe but we know from observation it's not
true of <i>our </i>universe. <br />
<br />
5. <b>Earth is at the Center of the Universe and We're at the Bottom
of a Gravity Well</b>. This idea was concocted by <b>Russell
Humphreys</b> and recently popular for a few years, then it crashed
and burned due to its basic mathematical blunders. Humphreys denied
the Copernican principle-- that the universe looks about the same no
matter where you are-- and says that all the galaxies form a big
sphere with the edge far away, and Earth at its center.&nbsp; Anyway,
Humphreys proposed that we're at the center of a spherical  universe
so that Earth would be at the bottom of a big gravity well, and in
General Relativity, time runs slower at the bottom of a gravity  well.
So 6,000 years can pass on Earth while billions of years pass out  in
the Universe, get it? No, it sucks on many levels.<br />
<br />
To start with, when light falls into a gravity well, it slows down, so
the wavelengths get shorter; it's shifted to the blue end of the
spectrum. That's the reason why the  signals from <b>GPS
satellites</b> have to be tuned to a slightly higher frequency than
the receivers on Earth are tuned to-- time runs slower in Earth's
gravity well, so the radiation is blue-shifted as it falls into
Earth's gravity. Thus if Earth were in a huge gravity well, the light
from distant galaxies would be blue-shifted, but it's actually
red-shifted.<br />
<br />
Also, there's no solution for intermediate distance objects-- what
about nearby stars or planets in the solar system? They should be
slowed down about as much as Earth, but instead they look very old:
Mars and Jupiter's moons have tons of craters, and among the asteroids
there is considerable evidences of long-term processes: from the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirkwood_gap">Kirkwood gaps</a> in
asteroid orbital periods, from the <a
href="http://thenaturalhistorian.com/2012/05/18/tumbling-rotating-asteroids-age-solar-system-young-earth/">tumbling
rate of larger vs. smaller asteroids</a>, and from <a
href="http://thenaturalhistorian.com/2011/09/21/the-history-of-a-asteroid-family/">running
the orbits of asteroid families backward in time until they coalesce
on the partent body from which they were broken off</a>, etc. we know
the asteroid families are tens of millions of years old. Likewise,
there's no smooth way to say Earth is young, asteroids are a tiny tiny
bit older, Pluto slightly older, etc. It's dead.<br />
<br />
This idea is often conflated with long-debunked claims that galaxies
are found in concentric shells with gaps between them, like a set of
Russian nesting dolls with Earth at the center. The alleged evidence
for the shell game is a bit of pseudoscience called "<b>quantized red
shift</b>" meaning that red shifts from distant galaxies supposedly
come in fixed intervals, therefore galaxies distance must come in
shells with gaps between them (they don't, and they're not). The
problem here is <i>hypothesis fishing</i>: if you analyze a bunch of
galactic distances and test them for, say, a thousand different
periodicities, the odds are that at least one periodicity will pass a
statistical test at a level of 1 in a thousand, <i>even if the data
you analyze is random</i>.&nbsp; Or if you test them for, say, a
million different periodicities, at least one  periodicity will pass a
statistical test at a level of 1 in a million, <i>even for randomized
data</i>.<br />
Hypothesis fishing is a classic blunder and you have to reject it by
doing the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonferroni_correction">Bonferroni
correction </a>and trying to reproduce the exact same method on a
totally independent data set.<br />
<br />
Anyway, if it weren't for the popularity of GPS technology, we'd still
have to deal with Humphreys' BLEEP, but now even most creationists
sweep it under the rug. Except that according to the recent Texas
newspaper article on ICR, the long-debunked "shells of galaxies" crap
is still one of ICR's big current lines of research.<br />
<br />
Now we'll finally get to Jason Lisle's idea, complicated yes, but
smart, no.<br />
<b>Jason Lisle's Solution: </b><b>Anisotropic Synchrony Convention
(ASC)</b><br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.answersingenesis.org/articles/arj/v3/n1/anisotropic-synchrony-convention">Lisle's
solution</a> is cobbled together from three different ideas, which we
should not get mixed up together.<br />
<br />
1. The&nbsp;<b>Anisotropic Synchrony Convention. </b>Here Lisle simply
<i>defines</i> all events happening in the universe, no matter what
the distance, as being simultaneous with what's happening now on
Earth. Simultaneity of any two events depends on the observer's
position, so I say events A and B are simultaneous, but if you're in a
different location, you say A happened before B (unless you are
sitting on my lap.) Thus, God could create the whole universe
<i>simultaneously relative to Earth</i> (see Point 3 below), and light
from distant objects would <i>instantaneously</i> arrive at Earth no
matter the distance -- but note that all creation events would <i>not
</i>besimultaneous relative to observers&nbsp; not on Earth. Believe
it or not, there is no way to falsify this because it's just a
convention, so it can't be rejected on observational grounds. The
problem is not terrible, but Lisle then combines it with the next two
ideas, which are disastrous.<br />
<br />
2. A <b>variable speed of light</b> that depends on the position of
the observer, and the position and direction of travel of the photon,
via the angle ÃÂÃÂ¸ made between the eye-line from the observer to the
photon and the photon's direction of travel. For all observers in the
universe, not just those on Earth, photons come straight at them at
infinite speed. Photons moving perpendicular to our line of sight move
at the conventional <i>c</i>. If a photon is approaching you at a
glancing angle, it decelerates precipitously, then at closest approach
to you it moves at speed <i>c</i>, and continues to slow down after it
passes you, as it recedes away finally approaching one-half the speed
of light (<i>c</i>/2). <b>If you jump to the left, the velocity of
every photon in the universe changes</b>. If you send a light beam to
bounce off a mirror on Alpha Centauri, 4.5 light years away, in
Einstein's convention it would take 4.5 years on each leg of the trip,
9 years total. But in Lisle's convention, it will take 9 years to get
there and zero time to bounce back. From the point of view of the guy
on Alpha Centauri, your light beam came to him instantly, and then
took 9 years to bounce back to you.<br />
<br />
This idea of Lisle's is disastrous as it <b>would induce an observable
gravity field</b> in General Relativity (GR) and also mucks up two
physical constants known from electromagnetic theory, the
<b>permeability and permittivity of free space</b>, which must then
become position-and-angle dependent instead of being constants. The
variable, position-dependent speed of light (2) is a separate idea
added onto the Synchrony Convention (1) above, though Lisle conflates
1 and 2, and incorrectly calls the combination a mere "coordinate
transformation." Falsely calling them both a mere "coordinate
transformation" was at the point of Lisle's promised refutation when
two years ago he wrote "<i>It is very easy to refute"</i>, then never
delivered.<i> </i>He can't deliver, because (2) is <i>not </i>a
coordinate transformation, because it sets the velocities of photons
to be dependent on their position and on their direction of
travel.&nbsp; Lisle never writes down his alleged coordinate
transformation as a matrix (which should be easy if he were telling
the truth) nor differentiates the matrix as is necessary.<br />
<br />
3. Lastly Lisle hypothesizes a <b>Cosmogony in which God creates the
universe in concentric shells</b>, outward from the edge of the
universe and coming in towards the place where Earth will finally be,
with a black sphere of "uncreated" nothingness in the center that
slowly contracts as God creates stars and galaxies one thin shell at a
time at the inner edge of the sphere. The creation "wave" converges on
the place where the Earth will be at a speed of <b>1/2 the speed of
light</b> (<i>not </i>the speed of light as some have thought, and as
<a href="http://creation.com/distant-starlight-and-genesis-conventions-of-time-measurement">Lisle
himself incorrectly wrote in an early paper</a>.) The intermediate
steps of creation involve one-quarter stars, half-galaxies, half-black
holes, three-quarter relativistic jets, etc. etc., and all kinds of
huge complex structures that are millions of miles or hundreds of
thousands of light years across, that God sloooowly constructs slice
by slice: <b>imagine a 3-D printer constructing a living human baby
slice by slice, while it cries, thinks, and poops, but somehow doesn't
die</b> even when it has half-arteries and half-veins, half-loops of
an intestine going in and out, half-brain etc. Same idea here, but
with half-stars and half-galaxies instead of a half-baby. Lisle
hypothesizes this cosmogony because if ASC is assumed then all
creations by shells would then be <i>simultaneous relative to an
observer on Earth</i>, if any existed (Day 4 of Creation Week, no
humans existed to watch it); though the creation process would&nbsp;
be <i>highly non-simultaneous</i>, relative to the planets and stars
getting created, and in fact it would all take ~80 billion years
(relative to a distant non-Earth observer) before God got around to
making Earth, because the observable univserse is ~40 billion
light-years across and creation shells would converge at half the
speed of light.<br />
<br />
It is not sufficient to call this cosmogony absurd or
counter-intuitive. It is wrong because it is non-falsifiable; because
the scientific method requires a theory to be simpler than the
observations it explains, but here Lisle's "God made colliding
galaxies <i>etc. </i>to trick us" hypothesis is always more complex
than all observations; and because, significantly, it <b>contradicts
its own assumptions</b>. YECs say that in principle, there can
<i>never </i>be "Appearance of Age" (there is Apperance of <i>Absence
</i>of Age) and their hypothesis is "Appearance of Maturity", but
"Maturity" has no definition except in terms of "function". But this
cosmogony has God slowly creating countless half-finished
non-functional entities that he must intervene to prop up
supernaturally when they're half-finished or quarter-finished. A baby,
as it is being printed by a 3-D printer, cannot be alive or functional
when its half-finished and its half-loops of intestines and blood
would squirt out, <b>it can't be "functional" without supernatural
intervention</b>. Likewise Lisle's cosmogony, to create well-balanced
stars and galaxies and black holes, which all have complex internal
structures and internal balance of gravitational pressure and photon
pressure, would require God to supernaturally create <b>far more fake
photons and fake neutrinos and fake phonons and fake convection
currents</b> etc., all with the appearance of being from events that
never happened-- <b>far more fake photons and phony light-shows than
Henry Morris ever conceived of</b>.<br />
<br />
<b>More on Strange Conventions of Simultaneity. </b><br />
<br />
Let's return to 1. While this convention is counter-intuitive, this
idea is not disastrous and does not by itself entail testable
predictions that might falsify it. All of us has have heard that
Einstein's Special Relativity begins with the assumption that <i>the
speed of light is the same for all observers in the universe</i>, so
that if an airplane shoots out a light beam, the light beam still
travels at only the speed of light <i>c </i>and not <i>c </i>plus the
speed of the airplane. This assumption is experimentally justified by
the Michelson-Morley experiment, which proved that light beams going
along the direction of the Earth's movement as it revolves around the
sun, have the same travel time as light beams going perpendicular to
the Earth's movement.<br />
<br />
However, Lisle and other creationists correctly and cleverly point out
that the Michelson-Morley experiment only measures the total travel
time for a light beam making a round trip, and there's no experimental
way to measure the speed of light going one way without some kind of
round trip arrangement. What if (let's say) the speed of light went
faster when going north and slower when going south, or vice versa,
and the round trip looked like <i>c</i> when averaged out? Or if light
went instantaneously going north and travelled at <i>c/2</i> when
going south, which averages out to <i>c</i>?<br />
<br />
In fact, there's no rule against that, not by itself. Einstein's
convention was that the speed of light goes at <i>c</i> in all
directions, which is simpler and makes the math easier, but it can't
be proven per se. You are permitted certain other conventions, e.g. if
you just have all north-going photons go faster and all south-going
photons go slower in a fashion that <i>does not depend on the position
of the photon</i>. Where Lisle screwed the pooch was by making light
speed depend on the position of the photon, which turns out to not be
allowed, and is not a coordinate transformation as he claims.<br />
<br />
For the permitted synchrony conventions, we must consider some bizarre
(but not forbidden) consequences for the idea of <b>simultaneity</b>.
The pre-Einstein idea of simultaneity was that it's the same for all
observers, so if events E1 and E2 are simultaneous for Bob, then E1
and E2 are also simultaneous for Julie, no matter where she is or if
she's moving relative to Bob.<br />
<br />
But with Einstein's convention, event E1 could happen before E2 for
Harry, if Harry is moving relative to Bob. What matters for Einstein
is direction of motion, not position. With Lisle's convention, it's
<i>position that matters, not motion:</i> so E1 could happen before E2
for Harry, if Harry is in a different place that Bob.<br />
<br />
Here's the classic Einstein "train" argument: Bob is standing on an
embankment as a train is passing; at the moment that the center of the
train passes Bob, two lightning bolts strike, E1 at the front and E2
at the back of the train. Bob says, "Both light signals come towards
me at the same speed <i>c</i> and traveled the same distance, so I
subtract the same amount off the times when I saw each flash, and
conclude E1 and E2 were simultaneous." But Harry is riding the train
in its center; he travels towards the photons from E1 and away from
the photons from E2, so he intercepts the E1 photons before those from
E2. Like Bob, Harry starts off saying, "Both light signals come
towards me at the same speed <i>c</i> and traveled the  same distance,
so I subtract the same amount off both times", but because Harry saw
E1's photons first, after subtraction he concludes E1 happened before
E2. This is bizarre, but it's basic Special Relativity. <br />
<br />
In Lisle's convention, what affects simultaneity is not velocity but
position. All the "shells of creation" as God creates the universe are
created simultaneously relative to some one point on Earth (Eden?),
but <i>not </i>simultaneously relative to any observers not on Earth.
This means that all observers outside Earth believe their planets were
created long, long before Earth; and for millions of years, as they
look in the direction where Earth will be, <b>they see only a sphere
of black nothingness because, relative to them, God hasn't created
Earth yet</b>. Indeed, for stars sufficiently far away but visible now
in our telescopes, <b>we <i>still </i>do not exist</b> <b>relative to
them</b>, and we can see them but they can't see us, because God has
not created the Earth yet, Adam has not eaten an apple yet, and you
don't exist.<br />
<br />
This produces strange hypothetical effects. [I owe this 'mirror'
argument to <b>Tim Reeves</b> of <a
href="http://quantumnonlinearity.blogspot.com/2010/10/answers-in-genesis-screw-up-again.html">Quantum
Nonlinearity</a>.] Now suppose Lillith blinks into existence at the
center of the Andromeda Galaxy at the moment it is created (hint: not
the same time Earth is created) and Lillith immediately picks up a
mirror. Back on Earth, at the moment Eve is created, she  thinks the
universe is all created simultaneously and assumes light from
Andromeda comes to her instantaneously too, so Eve immediately sees
brand new, young Lillith, way off in Andromeda, 2.5 million light
years away, picking up her mirror. Now suppose Eve sends light towards
Lillith; Eve thinks her light beam recedes from her at speed
<i>c</i>/2 and thus thinks it will take 5 million years to get to
Andromeda.<br />
<br />
When Eve is 5 million years old, her light finally reaches Lillith,
while Eve sees Lillith as also 5 million years old at that instant;
for Eve has been watching Lillith age the whole time, and <b>for the
whole 5 million years, Lillith's mirror has been black</b>
<b>reflecting nothingness because the Earth didn't exist yet for
her</b>. <i>Finally </i>Eve's light bounces off Lillith's mirror and
zips back to Eve at a speed Eve thinks is instantaneous by Lisle's
convention. So when Eve is really 5 million years old, she will
finally see her reflection, far away, and will see herself young and
newly created as reflected in a mirror held by 5-million-year-old
Lillith.<br />
<br />
What does Lillith see? At the moment she was created, she looked
around and saw <b>half of the Andromeda galaxy created (the side away
from Earth), but the other half </b><b>(in the direction where Earth
will someday be) just black emptiness</b>. Needless to say, <i>the
galaxy will not be "mature" or "functional"</i> as creationists claim,
because half a galaxy cannot be stable or functional; it will look
like a multi-armed spiral chopped in half, with spiral arms all sliced
up into disconnected half arc-circles or quarter-circles, etc. which
are rotating all the time, but the rotation of disconnected half-arcs
without gravitational balance will tear it to bits. Worse, at its
center will be half a giant black hole, and no one knows what half a
black hole would look like. If M31 had <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysical_jet#Relativistic_jet">relativist
jets</a> squirting out of the galactic center (M31 doesn't, but some
do), the jets could be split down the middle like Robin Hood's arrow,
or part of a jet could be coming out of the black sphere of still
uncreated space, phony particles contrived to look like the result of
phony events that never happened: a vast, slow trick of the
Deceiver-God. Then God will finish creating Andromeda slowly, relative
to itself-- slice by slice, at half the speed of light, so the second
half of the galaxy (radius= 50,000 ly) will take God 100,000 years to
finish, relative to Lillith; or no time relative to Eve.<br />
<br />
Lillith at her creation picks up a mirror, but sees no light from
Earth at all-- just blackness in that direction-- and waits until she
is five million years old. When she finally gets light from Earth,
that planet and Eve look young and newly created; but Lillith (like
all observers, under Lisle's convention) believes that photons
approach her instantaneously, therefore Lillith subtracts zero flight
time for photons coming from Earth.<br />
<br />
Conclusion: Lillith concludes that Andromeda was created 5 million
years before Earth, and that she is 5 million years older than Eve.
Eve by contrast concludes that Andromeda was created (about) the same
time as Earth, and that she and Lillith are the same age. <br />
<br />
Also we see here why the shells of creation must be created at
<i>c</i>/2 and not <i>c</i>: Lillith waits 5 million years before the
empty black sphere in the direction of Earth get filled up with
matter, but Andromeda is 2.5 million light years from where Earth will
be; therefore Lisle's cosmogony creates shells of matter at speed
<i>c</i>/2, so all large-scale structures will be completely unstable,
<i>not mature and not functional</i>, unless God supernaturally tricks
us, filling up all stars and galaxies with fake photons and fake
neutrinos and fake convection currents etc. that look like the
after-effects of real processes, except the events never happened. The
fake light show is not creation of "maturity", so Lisle's cosmogony
contradicts his claim that his all-powerful god is limited by
"appearance of maturity."<br />
<br />
In an earlier paper, Lisle, writing as Robert <b>Newton </b>(wow,
humble), says creation will converge on Earth at lightspeed.
<br />
<blockquote>
[Lisle]: <i>So, we present the following picture of Creation as
described in Genesis, but converted from observed time to calculated
time... this creation process moves inward; space is created nearer to
Earth... About <b>4.3 years before Earth is created, 'the beginning'
occurs for the space near Alpha Centauri</b></i> [which is 4.3 light
years away]. <i>...Finally the Earth is created.</i> [<a
href="http://creation.com/distant-starlight-and-genesis-conventions-of-time-measurement">Lisle's
early paper</a>, writing as Robert Newton.]
</blockquote>
<br />
Apparently wrong; it should be 8.6 years before Earth is created.
Probably Lisle caught this error later.

<br />
<b>Lisle's Variable Speed of Light Creates a Gravity Field in General
Relativity and is Not A Coordinate Change!</b><br />
<br />
We move on to where Lisle really screwed the pooch, with his variable
speed of light.<br />
<blockquote>
[Lisle]: <i>The act of choosing a synchrony convention is synonymous
with defining the one-way speed of light. If we select Einstein
synchronization, then we have declared that the speed of light is the
same in all directions. If we select ASC, then we have declared that
light is essentially infinitely fast when moving directly toward the
observer, and ÃÂÃÂ½c when moving directly away. Under ASC, the speed of
light as a function of direction relative to the observer (ÃÂÃÂ¸) is given
by <b>c(ÃÂÃÂ¸) = c/(1-cos(ÃÂÃÂ¸))</b>, where ÃÂÃÂ¸ = 0 indicates the direction
directly toward the observer.</i> [<a

Synchrony Convention: A Solution to the Distant Starlight Problem</a>.

191-207. Emphasis added.] </blockquote>
First, it is not true that <i>"The act of choosing a synchrony
convention is synonymous with defining the one-way speed of light."
</i>This might be true for some synchrony conventions where the speed
of light does not depend on position. But Lisle's variable speed of
light, <i><b>c</b></i><b>(</b><i><b>ÃÂÃÂ¸</b></i><b>) =
</b><i><b>c</b></i><b>/(1-</b><i><b>cos</b></i><b>(</b><i><b>ÃÂÃÂ¸</b></i><b>))</b>,
depends on <i><b>ÃÂÃÂ¸</b></i>, and <i><b>ÃÂÃÂ¸</b></i> depends the position
{x1,y1,z1} of the observer and on the position {x2,y2,z2} and
direction {v_x,v_y,v_z} of the photon. <i><b>&nbsp;</b></i><br />
<br />
<i><b>ÃÂÃÂ¸</b></i> is the angle between your line of sight to the photon
and its direction of travel: <i><b>ÃÂÃÂ¸</b></i> = 0 if it's coming at
you, so <i>c</i>(<i>ÃÂÃÂ¸</i>) is infinite, <i><b>ÃÂÃÂ¸</b></i> = 90 degrees
if perpendicular to your line of sight, so
<i><b>c</b></i><b>(</b><i><b>ÃÂÃÂ¸</b></i><b>)</b> = <i>c</i>, and
<i><b>ÃÂÃÂ¸</b></i> = 180 degrees if receding from you, so
<i>c</i>(<i>ÃÂÃÂ¸</i>) = <i>c</i>/2. If you jump to the left, the speed of
every photon in the universe changes. This is not a mere synchrony
convention nor is it a mere transformation of coordinates, as we'll
prove below. <br />
<br />
Valid synchrony conventions might be expressed as one or more
permitted coordinate transformations, which could be written as 4x4
matrices (3 space dimensions plus time dimension). For example, you
could say that all photons going north travel instantaneously and all
going south travel at <i>c</i>/2; that is not dependent on photon
position. But Lisle's <i><b>c</b></i><b>(</b><i><b>ÃÂÃÂ¸</b></i><b>) =
</b><i><b>c</b></i><b>/(1-</b><i><b>cos</b></i><b>(</b><i><b>ÃÂÃÂ¸</b></i><b>))
</b>rule is not uniquely fixed by his synchrony convention-- he does
not derive <i><b>c</b></i><b>(</b><i><b>ÃÂÃÂ¸</b></i><b>) =
</b><i><b>c</b></i><b>/(1-</b><i><b>cos</b></i><b>(</b><i><b>ÃÂÃÂ¸</b></i><b>))
</b>from his convention, he merely shows that it is consistent with
his convention, <b>but "consistent with" is not a derivation</b> <b>or
proof of uniqueness</b>. He calls it a "transformation of coordinates"
but never writes it down as a 4x4 matrix (Einstein does, that's called
the Minkowski transformation) and Lisle never differentiates it.<br />
<br />
Now Lisle was <a
href="http://quantumnonlinearity.blogspot.com/2010/10/answers-in-genesis-screw-up-again.html">confronted
with this fact by Timothy Reeves</a> to who I am indebted for this
argument.<br />
<br />
<br />
Because it depends on positions of the observer and of the photon, it
induces a gravitational field and curvature of space time. I will
explain this three ways: <b>A.</b> intuitively, <b>B.</b> by proving
that Lisle's rule can't be written as a mere "coordinate
transformation", and <b>C.</b> from General Relativity and <b>Jian Qi
Shen</b>'s scientific paper on synchrony conventions and the
Riemannian operator in GR.<br />
<br />
<b>Method A</b>. The easiest way to see the problem is to note that in
General Relativity, a speed of light <b><i>that varies with position
</i></b>and a gravity field are the same thing. In Lisle's rule, if a
photon comes at you, just missing you and glancing off, it's
decelerating all the time-- that's a gravity field. This is not the
case (for example) if we picked a synchrony convention where all
photons going north travel instantaneously and all going south travel
at <i>c</i>/2. Then lightspeed doesn't varies with direction but not
with position, so no gravity field.<br />
<br />
There, that wasn't so bad. <br />
<br />
<b>Method B</b>. <b>Just a Coordinate Change?</b> At his blog, Lisle's
only response to Reeves' critique was to claim that his ASC is just a
mere "coordinate change." Because he says this over and over, I have
to prove that his rule <i><b>c</b></i><b>(</b><i><b>ÃÂÃÂ¸</b></i><b>) =
</b><i><b>c</b></i><b>/(1-</b><i><b>cos</b></i><b>(</b><i><b>ÃÂÃÂ¸</b></i><b>))
</b>cannot ever be just a coordinate change. This should not be
painful even for those who hate linear algebra.<br />
<br />
First, a real coordinate transformation could be written as a 4x4
matrix. Lisle never does this. We want to show how velocities of
photons transform in Lisle's case, but for comparison we'll first show
how velocities add (for different observers) in Einstein's
conventions; that's easier.<br />
<br />
Consider an Einsteinian, special relativity transformation between two
observers, Unprimed Guy and Primed Guy, one of whom is moving at
velocity u relative to the other. In all of this I will consistently
multiply all time coordinates <i>t</i>, <i>t'</i> and so on by the
speed of light <i>c</i>, to give <i>ct</i>, <i>ct</i>', <i>cdt</i>,
<i>c</i><i>dt', </i>etc. units of meters; and I will always define v's
and u's as distance /(<b>time x <i>c</i></b>), so that all <i>u's</i>
and <i>v's</i> <b>have no units</b>. That just makes the equations
easier.<br />
<br />
To make it even easier, I'll mostly use one space dimension <i>x</i>
and time dimension <i>ct</i>. The first observer will see an event at
coordinates {<i>ct</i>, <i>x</i>} while the second person "Primed
Guy", traveling at speed <i>"beta"</i> with respect to Unprimed Guy,
will see the same event at coordinates {<i>ct</i>'<i>, x'</i>}.
(<i>"beta" </i>is a unitless velocity, that is, it's the normal
velocity <i>u</i> divided by <i>c</i>, = <i>u</i>/<i>c</i>.) The
matrix is then 2x2.<br />
<br />
We want to ask things such as: if a particle moves with velocity
<i>v</i> with respect to Unprimed Guy, what is its velocity <i>v'</i>
with respect to Primed Guy? For example, if an airplane shoots out a
light beam, and it goes at lightspeed relative to the pilot, will it
go faster than the speed of light relative to a ground observer?<br />
<br />
So first we build a 2x2 matrix. The <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_transformation">Minkowski
transformation</a> gives us the matrix:<br />
<br />
ct' = Gamma* [ ct - beta * x]<br />
<br />
x' = Gamma* [- beta * ct&nbsp; +&nbsp; x]<br />
<br />
Gamma == sqrt( 1 - beta*beta). If we write vectors in the form
{<i>ct</i>, <i>x</i>}, then Primed Guys' coordinates can be computed
from Unprimed Guy's by the usual multiplication of a matrix times a
vector:<br />
<br />
{<i>ct</i>', <i>x</i>'} = M* {<i>ct</i>, <i>x</i>}<br />
<br />
where M is a 2x2 matrix. That means that M's elements M00, M01 etc.
are defined by<br />
<br />
<i>ct'</i> =&nbsp; M00* <i>ct</i> + M01* <i>x</i><br />
<br />
<i>x'&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>= M10 *<i>ct</i>&nbsp; +&nbsp; M11* <i>x</i><br />
<br />
Of course subscript 0 is for time and 1 is for x.&nbsp; The elements
are easily seen from the above to be:<br />
<br />
M00 = <i>Gamma</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
M01 = - <i>Gamma</i>*<i>beta</i><br />
M10 = - <i>Gamma</i>*<i>beta</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; M11 = <i>Gamma</i><br />
<br />
These matrix elements depend on velocity beta but not on positions
{<i>ct</i>'<i>, x'</i>} nor {<i>ct</i><i>, x</i>}. As we shall see,
<b>Lisle's convention can't be written like this, because his M00, M01
etc. must depend on coordinates</b> {<i>ct</i><i>, x</i>} etc., which
is his fatal problem.<br />
<br />
We want to show how velocities add under Einstein conventions because
that's easier. So since velocities take the form <i>v</i> =
<i>dx</i>/<i>dt</i>, or actually I will divide by <i>c</i> and
write<br />
<br />
<i>v</i> == <i>dx</i>/<i>c dt</i><br />
<br />
we have to differentiate <i>dx</i>/<i>dt</i> but don't kill yourself
over it. From the matrix transformation above:<br />
<br />
<i>cdt'</i> = M00 <i>*</i> <i>cdt</i> <i>+ </i>M01* <i>dx</i><br />
<br />
<i>dx'</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = M10 <i>*</i> <i>cdt</i> <i>+ </i>M11*
<i>dx</i><br />
<br />
Dividing numerator and denominator by <i>cdt</i> to get:<br />
<br />
<i>v</i>' == <i>dx</i>'/<i>cdt'&nbsp; </i>= [M10 <i>*</i> <i>cdt</i>
<i>+ </i>M11* <i>dx</i>] / [M00 <i>*</i> <i>cdt</i> <i>+ </i>M01*
<i>dx</i>]<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; =&nbsp; [M10 <i>+ </i>M11* <i>dx</i>/<i>cdt</i>] /
[M00&nbsp; <i>+ </i>M01* <i>dx</i>/<i>cdt</i>]<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =&nbsp; [M10 <i>+ </i>M11* <i>v</i>] / [M00&nbsp;
<i>+ </i>M01* <i>v</i>]<br />
<br />
Where I plugged in <i>v</i> == <i>dx</i>/<i>c dt</i>. Now we have our
answer, because the matrix elements M00, M01 etc. were given above and
we just stick them in:<br />
<br />
<i>v</i>' = <i>dx</i>'/<i>cdt'&nbsp; = </i>= [<i>v</i> - <i>beta</i>]
/ [1 - <i>beta*v</i>]<br />
<br />
There, that wasn't so bad was it! You derived the relativistic
equation for "adding" velocities. OK, now can we do this with Lisle's
rules? No.<br />
<br />
We want a guess a matrix like M00, M01 etc. that <b>transforms from a
photon's coordinates in Einstein's convention to one in Lisles'
convention</b>. What would matrix M look like? Lisle never tells us M,
but we can guess some stuff about M from what he requires for photon
velocities.<br />
<br />
Consider a photon coming straight at you along the x-axis. Just like
before, no change:<br />
<br />
<i>ct'</i> = M00* <i>ct</i> + M01* <i>x</i><br />
<br />
<i>x' </i>= M10 * <i>ct</i>&nbsp; +&nbsp; M11* <i>x</i><br />
<br />
The only difference is that Einstein tells us M00, M01 etc. but Jason
Lisle doesn't. He makes us guess at M00, M01 by dropping hints about
photon velocities. So we have to relate the photon velocity in Lisle's
convention, <i>v</i>', to the photon velocity in Einstein's
convention, <i>v</i><i>. </i>With the same trick of differentiating
and rearragning we get the same equation:<br />
<br />
<i><i>v</i>' =</i> [M10 <i>+ </i>M11* <i>v</i>] / [M00&nbsp; <i>+
</i>M01* <i>v</i>]<br />
<br />
Same as before, except now we don't know what M00, M01 etc. are<br />
<br />
Now you can see what's very wrong with this. Consider a photon coming
straight at you along the x-axis.&nbsp; But problem, what happens when
the approaching photon zips past you? In Einstein's convention,
<i>v</i> does not change; in Lisle's convention, <i><i>v</i>' </i>is
supposed to instantly decelerate to 1/2 (that's <i>c</i>/2 divided by
<i>c</i>). <b>The right half of the equation above does not change as
the photon passes you; the left half of the equation changes
infinitely</b>. This cannot happen <i>unless the matrix elements M00,
M01 etc. depend on coordinates of observer and of photon</i>, so that
they "know" when to slow down-- but if M00, M01 etc. depend on
coordinates of observer and of photon, that is no longer a mere
"coordinate transformation" as Lisle claims, but instead <b>a
non-linear transformation of space-time. And a a non-linear
transformation of space-time means space-time is curved. That means
gravity</b>.<br />
<i> </i><br />
Above I considered the simple case of one space coordinate and time.
What if we do three space coordinates and time? Relax, I'm not going
to repeat the whole thing. I'll just skip to the end.<br />
<br />
Consider a photon coming at you at an arbitrary angle and glancing
off. But I have to define the velocity of the photon as a vector with
three space components along three axes, plus time, that is,
{<i>ct</i>, <i>v_x</i>, <i>v_y</i>, <i>v_z</i>} for Einstein's photon
velocity and {<i>ct'</i>, <i>v_x'</i>, <i>v_y'</i>, <i>v_z'</i>} for
Lisle's photon velocity. The rule for four coordinates is pretty
obvious so I'll skip the blah blah blah and jump to it:<br />
<br />
<i><i>v_x</i>' =</i> [M10 <i>+ </i>M11* <i>v_x</i> <i>+ </i>M12*
<i>v_y</i> <i>+ </i>M12* <i>v_z</i>]/[M00 <i>+ </i>M01* <i>v_x</i>
<i>+ </i>M02* <i>v_y</i> <i>+ </i>M02* <i>v_z</i>]<br />
<br />
There are similar equations for <i><i>v_y'</i></i> and <i><i>v_z</i>'
</i>which I'll skip. The speed of the photon is then<br />
<br />
v' = sqrt( <i><i>v_x</i>'</i>^2 <i>+ </i><i><i>v_y</i>'</i>^2 +
<i><i>v_z</i>'</i>^2)<br />
<br />
<b>Problem: </b>according to Lisle, the whole time the photon
approaches it's decelerating. That means, again, <b>the left-hand side
of the equation changes with position, but the right hand side
cannot</b>. Not unless M00, M01 etc. depend on coordinates {<i>x, y,
z</i>} -- but that would falsify Lisle's claim that he's only doing a
coordinate transformation.<br />
<br />
C. <b>Jian Qi Shen's Paper on Synchrony Conventions and the
Riemannian</b>.<br />
<br />
For a more professional take,&nbsp; <a
href="http://quantumnonlinearity.blogspot.com/2010/10/answers-in-genesis-screw-up-again.html">Timothy
Reeves</a> cited a <a
href="http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/physics/pdf/0509/0509012v1.pdf">physics
paper by Jian Qi Shen</a> [PDF] on the subject of synchrony
conventions in General Relativity. He emphasizes that some syncrhony
conventions are kosher, but if you don't follow the rules they produce
a gravity field. Shen considers <i>g</i>, the spacetime metric tensor,
which is used to measure distance between two points in a curved space
time; the value of <b><i>g</i> tells you whether or not space is
curved, and therefore whether or not a gravity field exists</b> (more
technical description below.)<br />
<br />
Shen writes <i>g</i> in terms of a parameter <i>X</i> which in turn
depends on in what way the speed of light is anisotropic-- how <i>c
</i>varies in all directions. A "kosher" synchrony convention would be
something like: all photons going north move at infinite speed; all
photons going south move at <i>c</i>/2. In these case <i>X </i>would
depend on direction of travel, but not depend on coordinates x, y, z,
so then the <i>g</i> takes on a value <i>for flat space-time, no
gravity</i>.<br />

To be more technical, what tells you if space-time is curved is the
<b>Riemannian curvature tensor</b> <b>[<i>R</i>] </b>that is derived
from <i>g</i> which depends on <i>X</i>.<br />
<br />
But in Lisle's convention,&nbsp; X would depend on
(<b>1-</b><i><b>cos</b></i><b>(</b><i><b>ÃÂÃÂ¸</b></i><b>)) </b>which in
turn depends on coordinates {x,y,z} of the photon and of the observer.
Thus metric tensor <i>g</i> depends on coordinates via <i>X</i>, and
the <b>Riemannian curvature tensor does not vanish, so space-time is
curved, therefore Lisle's convention makes a gravity field, but this
is not observed</b>.
<br />
<br />
Compare this to what Lisle wrote:

<br />
<br />
<blockquote>
<i>The anisotropic synchrony convention is just that: a convention. It
is not a scientific model; it does not make testable predictions. It
is a convention of measurement and cannot be falsified any more than
the metric system can be falsified.</i>
[<a href="https://answersingenesis.org/astronomy/starlight/anisotropic-synchrony-convention-distant-starlight-problem/">Jason
Lisle</a>, 2010]

</blockquote>
It makes testable predictions, it can be falsified, it was falsified.<br />
<br />
<b>Problems with Permittivity and Permeability of Free Space</b><br />
<br />
Lisle has more problems with two physical constants that are important
in electromagnetic theory, the permeability of free space
<i>ÃÂÃÂ¼</i><sub>0</sub> and the permittivity of free space,
<i>ÃÂÃÂµ</i><sub>0</sub>. These two constants are involved in electronics,
setting the strength of electrostatic attraction and the relationship
between current and and magnetic field. They are together intimately
connected to the speed of light <i>c</i>, so Lisle mucking with the
speed of light will mess with them too. In ordinary units c is
determined by the identity <i>&nbsp;</i><br />
<br />
<i>c^</i>2 = 1/ <i>ÃÂÃÂ¼</i><sub>0</sub> *&nbsp; <i>ÃÂÃÂµ</i><sub>0</sub>.<br />
<br />
Since Lisle makes c depend on <i><b>ÃÂÃÂ¸</b></i><b> </b>which varies with
the position of the photon, <i>ÃÂÃÂ¼</i><sub>0</sub> and
<i>ÃÂÃÂµ</i><sub>0</sub> must depend on position as well. For this point I
am indebted to <a

<b>A Final Comment on the Deceiver-God and His Creation With
"Appearance of Maturity"</b><br />
<br />
Because Lisle is today's most aggressive pusher of&nbsp;
"<b>Appearance of Age</b>" argument, I'm going to discuss its
paradoxes in more detail. The term "<i>Omphalos</i>" means "belly
button" and is used to describe generic creationist  arguments in
which God deceptively makes the universe look different  then it
actually is, typically by creating the appearance of an ancient
history that never really happened. The term was coined by <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Henry_Gosse">Phillip Henry
Gosse</a> in his 1857 creationist book. Much like creationists after
him, he argued by analogy: God had to create Adam with a belly button
"<i>omphalos</i>" even though Adam had never been connected to an
umbilical cord, because the <i>function</i> of the human body requires
a belly button; and likewise, the function
of the planet Earth requires fake fossils in the ground that look just
like dead animals even though they never really lived.<br />
<br />
Gosse's "fake fossils" idea was received very negatively by all sides,
and today all big-money creationists would deny that they employ it;
but in fact, all YECs, especially Jason Lisle, still invoke Omphalos
for countless things-- for certain fossils, for starlight, or
radiometric dating, or tree rings in ancient trees-- they just grew
<i>sneakier</i> about it, choosing their Omphalos targets by carefully
assessing what their target audience would consider absurd and what
they could get away with.<br />
<br />
All big-money creationists today would deny that they believe dinosaur
fossils are fake-- but in fact, they only really assert  the reality
of fossils <i>of complex animals and plants </i>from the post-Cambrian
era (e.g. dinosaurs). Many older or non-dinosaur fossils can still be
tricks, for example, fossil <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proterozoic#mediaviewer/File:Stromatolites_Cochabamba.jpg"><b>stromatolites</b></a>
(multi-layered bacterial mats) and <i><a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grypania">Grypania</a></i>
(multicellular algae) if they are pre-Cambrian are dismissed as not
organic but made in some vague way, while post-Cambrian stromatolites
that look just the same are indisputably organic. YECs treat dinosaurs
and pre-Cambrian fossils differently because 1. Kids love dinosaurs
but don't know about stromatolites or <i>Grypania</i>, and YECs know
what their audience knows, and 2.  YECs say that Noah's Flood started
in the geological column at about the  time of the Cambrian explosion,
that is, with the first trilobite fossils. (By contrast the
Ultra-Orthodox rabbi <b>Menachem Schneerson</b> did in fact teach his
fanatical followers that dinosaur fossils are fakes planted by the
devil; and some Jews in Israel demanded that dinosaur cartoons be
taken off of kid's milk cartons <i>because dinosaurs never
existed</i>.) Furthermore, there are huge numbers of pre-Cambrian
marks from long, long before the dinosaur era like sedimentary strata,
raindrop impressions, water ripples, dessication cracks, granite
intrusions, etc. that look like records of past events, but which YECs
like <b>Robert Gentry</b> say were created directly by God during
Creation Week to look just like events that never happened.<br />
<br />
Tree rings in very ancient trees, like the bristlecone pines are up to
4,900 years old which makes the oldest 600 years older than Noah's
Flood. Tree rings don't just look old, they <b>record
<i>history</i></b>, for example forest fires, droughts, climatic
cycles, etc. and they agree with each other and with known cyclic
variations in solar output. Observe how Frank Lorey, writing for Jason
Lisle's current employer, the ICR, bats away tree rings with a bit of
Deceiver-God.
<br />
<br />
<blockquote>
[Frank Lorey of ICR]: <i>Also, creation had to involve some
superficial appearance of earth history. <b>Trees were likely created
with tree-rings already in place</b>. Rocks would likely have yielded
old dates by the faulty radio-isotope
methods in use today. Even man and animals did not appear as infants.
This is known as the <b>"Appearance of Age Theory."</b></i> [Frank
Lorey, M.A. 1994. <a
href="http://www.icr.org/article/tree-rings-biblical-chronology/">Tree
Rings and Biblical Chronology.</a> Acts &amp; Facts (ICR). 23: (6)]
</blockquote>
<br />
Note that Morris and his ICR colleagues all used to call it
"Appearance of Age theory", but later YECs later decided we must never
call it that, we must only call it "<b>Appearance of
<i>Maturity</i></b>" since changing the name of a problem solves the
problem. You see, the term "Appearance of Age" that they made up was a
dirty trick played on them by evil evolutionists! And evolutionists
even brainwashed Henry Morris, I guess, since he called it "Appaerance
of Age" in <i>The Genesis Flood</i>.<br />
<br />
Now they tell us, see, everything in the Garden of Eden was perfect,
so any "Appearance of <i>Age</i>" can't be real but is just a trick
played on them by evolutionist brainwashing; and they've been tricked
because Adam ate an apple in the Garden and "Fell" and that makes our
reason and our senses unreliable, as creationism itself amply proves.
Now YECs insist that <b>appearance of Age cannot ever be objectively
real, but <i>Appearance of Youth </i>is objectively real</b>. Here's
Ken Ham of Answers in Genesis on fake tree rings.<br />
<blockquote>
[Ken Ham]: [on Creation Week] <i>The various original plants,
including trees, would have mature fruit... <b>Perhaps trees even had
tree rings</b>, as a regular part of the tree's structure. Adam and
Eve and the animals were <b>created mature and fully functional</b> so
they could reproduce. But none of these things were 'old' or 'looked
old.'</i> [Ken Ham. <a
href="http://www.answersingenesis.org/articles/am/v3/n4/mature-age">Mature
for Her 'Age'</a>. AIG. August 25, 2008.]

</blockquote>
Never looked old? His wife must love him. Again, everyone has to call
it "Appearance of <i>Maturity</i>" now, with maturity defined in terms
of "function"... but "function" undefined. This vagueness can be
exploited to <b>falsely claim observations as "predictions" of the
creationist model</b>, a business that Jason Lisle, Ph.D. has built
his career on. <br />
<br />
Lisle never claimed that dinosaur fossils are fake, and rejected
Morris' hypothesis that God created phony photons, neutrinos etc.
<i>en route</i> from distant stars, so you might think Lisle rejects
Omphalos. But you'd be wrong-- he's a presuppositionalist who defends
"Appearance of Age" (don't call it "Appearance of Age!") more
aggressively than any other YEC today. He just applies it to a <b>huge
number of other things</b> besides Henry Morris' fake supernovae, or
Gosse's fake dino fossils. Lisle's "ASC" solution to the Starlight
Problem <b>requires a different kind of fake photons created directly
by God</b>, on a far larger scale than Morris ever imagined, but
Lisle's fake photons have to be way out in space and not necessarily
the ones we see.
 <br />
<br />
Here's an example of how devoted to Omphalos Lisle is: at a
creationist meeting, Chris Sharp asked Lisle to explain <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirkwood_gap">Kirkwood Gaps</a>.
What are those? Well, if you plot the time periods that it takes all
asteroids to make one revolution around the sun, you get a big scatter
plot of diverse time periods, but certain periods are conspicuously
absent-- those which are related to the period of Jupiter by a ratio
of small integers. This can be easily explained by simple physics:
over millions of years, Jupiter would approach those asteroids over
and over, until its giant gravity field knocked them out of that
orbit, clearing out the Kirkwood Gap. Simple-- if the solar system is
more than a few
millions of years old. But Lisle, put on the spot, yanks Deceiver-God
out of his ass:<br />
<blockquote>
[Christopher Sharp writes]: <i>...I asked [Lisle] about... the
Kirkwood gaps in the asteroid belt, showing irrefutably that the Solar
System is much more than 6000 years old... I pointed out to him that
after a few hundred thousand or million years of
 simulated time on a computer, asteroids in certain orbits are
ejected, which confirms the Kirkwood gaps, to which he replied that
<b>God created the Solar System to appear that way.</b> </i>[<a
href="http://www.csharp.com/lisle.html">Christopher Sharp</a> on
Lisle's visit to Tucson]
</blockquote>
Lisle especially demands that we must always call it "<i>appearance of
maturity</i>" because if you
call it a different name, that makes it plausible. He insists that
"Appearance of Age" can't be objectively real but claims "Apperance of
Youth" all through the universe is objectively real, because <i>the
absence of age is real, but its presence cannot be</i>.<br />
<br />
They define "maturity", if at all, in terms of "function"... but
<b>"function" is undefined</b>. This becomes a big problem later when
you ask what's the "function" of colliding galaxies, or a supernova,
or its expanding nebula; and if you can't define "function", how can
you define "mature"?<br />
<br />
Creationists of course invoke an infinite number of teleological
arguments: if the moon reflects light, its purpose is to reflect
light; if glaciers melt in the spring, their purpose is to melt in the
spring-- these are real creationist arguments, not parodies. So how do
you define "maturity" or "function" of a supernova? Is its function to
blow up?<br />
<br />
Well, what Lisle does is, first he asks what real scientists have
observed, and then he computes what scientific facts he can lie to his
church audience about (some of Lisle's favorite "ha ha sucker" lies:
<i>scientists never observed stars or solar systems forming! Spiral
galaxies can't last more than a few million years, because they'll
unwind!</i>), and he takes the sum of those two sets and tells his
church audience that those are the "predictions" of the creationist
model. <b>Fraudictions</b>, more like it.<br />
<br />
All YECs including Lisle also deny that their god is a deceiver,
feigning to be angry about it, on the grounds that God said one thing
in the Bible and contradicted himself in the rocks and bones and
stars, but he told the truth in the Bible, and contradiction is not
deception. Of course, in the Bible God makes no mention of minutely
arranging the ratios of daughter and parent isotopes in rocks, so that
the more deeply buried rocks look much older than the surface rocks,
or making fake  stromatolites, or arranging asteroids into the
Kirkwood Gaps. So he never really told us what he did or how he did
it, or when or how we will some more Appearance of A-- excuse me,
<i>Maturity</i>.<br />
<br />
<b>Conclusion: Lisle's Magical Cosmogony Fails</b><br />
<br />
I raise all these issues of how you define "maturity" and "function"
because Lisle's cosmogony, in which God slooowly creates the universe
in concentric shells, <i>contradicts all their jive about how God is
required to create a "mature" universe</i>, how their all-powerful God
is unable to create a non-mature universe, like "mature"
<b>relativistic jets</b> that are a hundred thousand light years long
and would take at least a hundred thousand years to form, or the
"mature" after-effects of galaxies colliding, or star clusters that
penetrate our galaxy and in their "mature" form are torn up to shreds
like shredded cotton run over sand paper.<br />
<br />
In Lisle's cosmogony, God creates quarter-stars, then half-start, then
three quarter stars, etc. and he does so slowly. The <i>intermediate
stages are not mature and not functional</i>. Some stars are 100 times
bigger than our sun, and at speed <i>c</i>/2 it would take God a long
time to finish one. A star is a complicated machine, and it depends on
balance. In Lisle's cosmology, when God has a star one-third finished,
either the thing is not stable, not mature and not functional, and it
will <b><i>collapse or explode</i></b>;  or else God is supernaturally
creating vast numbers of fake photons, fake phonons, fake convection
currents etc. that <b>appear to come from events that never
happened</b>: more Omphalos. The photons normally start from nuclear
fusion in the core and take a very long time to work their way to the
surface. The photon pressure pushing "up" is required to balance the
gravitational weight pulling down, or else the whole shebang is
unstable, and will either collapse or explode. But when God has a star
is one-quarter finished, he would need to create fake photons that
appear to come from the core of the star (which doesn't exist yet)
produced by nuclear reactions (that never happened) in order to
balance the whole thing. <br />
<br />
Stars have complex internal structures, including convection currents
far larger than many Earths that swirl around the interior, spherical
harmonic vibrations jiggling the surface like a snare drum, solar
flares and vast magnetically-guided storms that burst from the
surface. All of these are part of their function and thus, "maturity."
When God has a star one-quarter finished, they either collapse, or
else God&nbsp; supernaturally creates huge numbers of fake phonons,
magnetic fields etc. from events that never happened.<br />
<br />
Similar arguments apply for even bigger structures: colliding
galaxies, relativistic jets a hundred thousand light years long, vast
nebulae, star birthing regions, elephant trunks, the Great Cosmic
Bubble in the Magellanic Cloud, and on and on. All these structures
would take Lisle's God a long time to slowly build, slice by slice,
and the intermediate stages would not be mature and not functional,
thus contradicting creationist blather about "Appearance of
Maturity".<br />
<br />
Reading Jason Lisle's blog, it's clear he wants his acolytes to know
as little as possible about large-scale cosmic structure: he wants
church audiences to think there basically is no large-scale structure
in  space-- like stars are just, you know randomly distributed or
something! He knows the structure of the universe plus YEC requires an
Omphalos Deceiver-God creating phony photons and phony particles in
relativistic jets like records of make-believe histories that never
happened.
