Discovery Institute Fellow <a href="http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&id=97&isFellow=true">Jonathan Witt</a> is trumpetting his op-ed piece in a Kansas newspaper (see the <a href="http://www.kansascity.com/mld/kansascity/news/opinion/11591675.htm">piece</a> and <a href="http://www.idthefuture.com/index.php?p=322&more=1&c=1&tb=1&pb=1">blog1</a>, <a href="http://wittingshire.blogspot.com/2005/05/kansas-scarecrow-showing-its-straw.html">blog2</a>, [url=]etc.[/url]) which purports to point out the errors in textbooks, and gives us a preview of what is coming if the creationists get their favorite alleged "weaknesses of evolution" taught in Kansas.  The piece was one of four op-ed articles published on the Kansas blowup.

Witt mostly uncritically repeats the twisted propaganda Wells has been distributing (peppered moths never rest on tree trunks, Haeckel's embryo drawings are widely found in modern textbooks and embryo similarities are a myth, transitional fossils don't exist, etc. See <a href="http://www.ncseweb.org/icons/">here</a>, <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/wells/">here</a>, and <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-transitional.html">here</a> for refutations referring to the primary literature). 

However, one bit of weirdness seems to be a new invention by Witt.  In the midst of a yet another rehash of the "Oh no, big phylum-level-differences differences arose in the Cambrian" argument (see the recent post <a href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/pt-archives/000969.html">Down with phyla!</a> to see how this problem evaporates when cladistics is applied), Witt makes the following peculiar statement:

<quote>These aren't just distinct species but distinct phyla, categories so large that man and bat occupy not only the same phylum but the same subphylum.</quote>

That's right folks, humans and bats occupy the same <i>subphylum</i>.  Wow, subphyla are such big groups! 

(If this joke doesn't make sense to people -- the point is a bit subtle -- I will attempt to explain later on.)
