Steve Matheson, who has been sparring with IDists about their misrepresentations regarding "junk" DNA, has started a series of posts about introns at <a href="http://sfmatheson.blogspot.com/">Quintessence of Dust</a> that's pitched at the intelligent lay person level and is highly recommended.  <a href="http://sfmatheson.blogspot.com/2010/06/introns-lets-think-about-this-people.html">Part 1</a> and <a href="http://sfmatheson.blogspot.com/2010/06/introns-lets-think-about-this-people_29.html">Part 2</a> are up so far.
