The <url href="http://www.ucsusa.org/">Union of Concerned Scientists</url> has released a six section <url href="http://www.ucsusa.org/scientific_integrity/interference/intelligent-design.html">overview</url> on Science, Evolution, and Intelligent Design


Section 1: <url href="http://www.ucsusa.org/scientific_integrity/interference/science-way-of-knowing.html">Science as a Way of Knowing</url><br />
Section 2: <url href="http://www.ucsusa.org/scientific_integrity/interference/science-and-society.html">Science and Society</url><br />
Section 3: <url href="http://www.ucsusa.org/scientific_integrity/interference/evolution-creationism-and-id.html">Evolution, Creationism, and Intelligent Design</url><br />
Section 4: <url href="http://www.ucsusa.org/scientific_integrity/interference/why-id-is-not-science.html">Why Intelligent Design is not Science</url><br />
Section 5: <url href="http://www.ucsusa.org/scientific_integrity/interference/science-education-and-id.html">Science Education and Intelligent Design</url><br />
Section 6: <url href="http://www.ucsusa.org/scientific_integrity/interference/fairness-and-balance.html">Fairness and Balance in the Classroom and Beyond</url><br />

I would add another section on the scientific vacuity or infertility of Intelligent Design. Ask yourself this simple question: What non-trivial contribution has Intelligent Design made to our scientific understanding? And ask you then a follow-up question: For those systems which ID claims to be designed, how does ID explain these systems?

The answers, or lack thereof, may surprise you.
