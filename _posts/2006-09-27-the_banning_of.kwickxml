Monday, <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/authority/2006/09/help_help_im_being_repressed.php">I posted an entry here</a> that discussed, in part,  <a href="http://www.evolutionnews.org/2006/09/banned_book_of_the_year_of_pan.html">a Discovery Institute blog article</a> claiming that the Dover ruling qualifies the <a href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2005/11/missing_link_cd.html">cdesign proponentsists</a> textbook Of Pandas and People as a "banned book." As I explained at the time, the claim is complete and total nonsense, so I suppose I really should have guessed that the anti-evolution movement would get behind it in a hell of a hurry. 

That appears to be just what's happening. The latest twists involve <a href="http://www.uncommondescent.com/archives/1652">the Uncommon Descent blog</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_banned_books">the Wikipedia entry for banned books</a>.
