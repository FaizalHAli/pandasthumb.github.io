It's always nice when someone who has some clue about the relevant science decides to write an article on the ID issue.  I would like to highlight <a href="http://barometer.orst.edu/vnews/display.v/ART/2005/05/12/428385ad0100b">this article</a> by Sanjai Tripathi, a microbiology grad student at <a href="http://www.orst.edu">Oregon State University</a>.  His opinion piece appeared in the OSU <i>Daily Barometer</i>, and no, even though I grew up in Corvallis, Oregon, I didn't have anything to do with it.

One minor quibble: Tripathi uses the "reducing irreducible complexity" rhetoric.  But the core issue is not really whether or not a system is <i>irreducible</i>, it is whether or not a system is <i>unbuildable</i>.  This is a very different thing.  A system that is currently irreducible for its current function might well be buildable anyway, most obviously via change-of-function.  Tripathi talks about change-of-function anyway, so he basically knows what is up.  But as a general rule, it is important for ID skeptics to keep in mind that "irreducible complexity" has never received a consistent definition, and that various ID proponents and ID opponents use the term to mean some very different things.  See the entry on "<a href="http://www.evowiki.org/index.php/Definitional_Complexity">definitional complexity</a>" at <a href="http://www.evowiki.org">Evowiki</a>.
