[The Cartwright Lab](http://cartwrig.ht/lab) at [Arizona State University](http://www.asu.edu/)
in Tempe, AZ is seeking multiple
Postdoctoral Research Associates in the areas of Evolutionary Genomics,
Statistics, and Bioinformatics to develop methodologies and study evolutionary
questions related to mutation and short-read sequencing. Successful applicants
will join a rapidly growing and well-funded lab involved on a variety of active
research projects and collaborations. Current projects include
1. the analysis of cilliate mutation accumulation lines,
2. the development of software for de-novo mutation detection from traditional and single-cell sequencing datasets,
3. the analysis of non-pathogenic somatic mutation patterns in mammals and plants,
4. the study of indel patterns across the tree of life,
5. characterizing mutations and fitness-landscapes of metabolically engineered microbes,
6. population genetics of malaria parasites,
7. the construction of phylogenies from short-read, whole genome datasets, and
8. simulation techniques for molecular evolution research.

[The Cartwright Lab](http://cartwrig.ht/lab) is part of the [Center for Evolutionary Medicine and
Informatics (CEMI)](http://cemi.asu.edu/), one of 10 research centers in [Arizona State Universityâ€™s
Biodesign Institute](http://biodesign.asu.edu/). Research in the Cartwright Lab covers many different
questions in population genetics and molecular evolution, at the interface of
biology, statistics, and computer science. A majority of our research involves
developing, implementing, and applying novel methodologies to study genomic
datasets. Members have the opportunity to develop both dry-lab and wet-lab
research programs through interactions with both national and international
collaborations.

As part of this project, the Postdoctoral Research Associates are expected to
be able to:
1. Assemble microbial or metazoan genomes from short-read sequences and identify variable sites and regions.
2. Develop novel, high-throughput methodologies to study mutations from next generation sequencing of related individuals and cells.
3. Work closely with collaborators to customize methodologies to specific experimental designs.

**Required Qualifications:**

Ph.D. in genomics, bioinformatics, or a related field

**Desired Qualifications:**

1. Experience working with genomes and evolutionary analyses
2. Knowledge of programming languages including R, Python, and C++
3. Knowledge of statistical methodologies
4. Experience with short-read sequencing

**Application must contain:**

1. Resume
2. Cover Letter
3. Names, addresses, and phone numbers of three professional references

**Deadline for applications is  May 1, 2014. Applications will continue to be
accepted and considered until the job is filled/closed.**

**To apply, forward one document that includes a cover letter, detailed CV,
and names of 3 references to
<cartwright@asu.edu>.** Please put the job title in
the subject line of the letter.
