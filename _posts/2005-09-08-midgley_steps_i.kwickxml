<p>You might recognize philosopher Mary Midgley as the author <a href="http://www.royalinstitutephilosophy.org/articles/midgley_gene_juggling.htm">of this egregiously bad</a> review, published in the journal <i>Philosophy</i> in 1979, of Richard Dawkins' book <i>The Selfish Gene</i>.  In the course of her lengthy review, Midgley managed to misunderstand and misrepresent virtually every aspect of Dawkins' argument.  Dawkins subsequently refuted her arguments  in <a href="http://www.royalinstitutephilosophy.org/articles/dawkins_genes.htm">this devastating reply.</a>  In fairness, Midgley subsequently apologized for her intemperate tone <a href="http://www.royalinstitutephilosophy.org/articles/midgley_genes.htm">here</a>.</p>

<p>Well, it seems that Dawkins still has the ability to literally drive Midgley crazy.  In response to <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/life/feature/story/0,,1559743,00.html">this recent op-ed</a>, co-authored by Dawkins and Jerry Coyne in the British newspaper <i>The Guardian</i>, Midgley wrote a remarkably misinformed letter to the editor.  Click <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/letters/story/0,,1563242,00.html">here</a> (hers is the first letter).  I analyze the situation <a href="http://evolutionblog.blogspot.com/2005/09/midgley-steps-in-it-again.html">in this post</a> over at <a href="http://evolutionblog.blogspot.com">EvolutionBlog.</a></p>
