<p>One of the goals of the intelligent design (ID) movement is to show that evolution cannot be random and/or unguided, and one way to demonstrate this is to show that an evolutionary transition is impossibly unlikely without guidance or intervention. Michael Behe has attempted to do this, <a href="http://sfmatheson.blogspot.com/2008/10/why-im-not-behe-fan-conclusion-and.html">without success</a>. And Doug Axe, the  director of  Biologic Institute, is working on a similar problem. Axe's work (most recently with a colleague, Ann Gauger) aims (in part, at least) to show that evolutionary transitions at the level of protein structure and function are so fantastically improbable that they could not have occurred &quot;randomly.&quot;</p>
<p>Recently, Axe has been writing on this issue. First, he and Gauger just published some <a href="http://bio-complexity.org/ojs/index.php/main/article/view/BIO-C.2011.1">experimental results</a> in the ID journal <em>BIO-Complexity</em>. Second, Axe wrote a <a href="http://biologicinstitute.org/2011/05/04/correcting-four-misconceptions-about-my-2004-article-in-jmb/">blog post</a> at the Biologic site in which he defends his approach against <a href="http://sfmatheson.blogspot.com/2010/05/bread-and-circus-signature-in-cell-at_28.html">critics like Art Hunt and me</a>. Here are some comments on both.</p>
