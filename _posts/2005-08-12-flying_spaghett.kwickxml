<img place="left" src="http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/images/Flying_SM_cosmic.jpg"/>Flying Spaghetti Monsterism has officially hit the bigtime.  See "<url href="http://www.courant.com/features/lifestyle/hc-fsm0812.artaug12,0,1036163.story?&track=rss">Spaghetti Monster Stringing Us Along</url>," in the <i>Hartford Courant</i>.  This national press attention obviously proves that there is a scientific controversy over <url href="http://www.venganza.org/">His Noodly Appendage</url>, which should be taught in public school science classrooms in Kansas and elsewhere.  Really, the views of <url href="http://www.courant.com/features/lifestyle/hc-fsm0812.artaug12,0,1036163.story?&track=rss">Pastafarians</url> are just as legitimate as anyone else's views on origins, so they deserve promotion at state expense also.  Or are you against free speech and academic freedom?
