<img align="left" src="http://www.zooatlanta.org/images/deepblue_photos/giant_panda/pandas.jpg"/> <a href="http://www.zooatlanta.org">Zoo Atlanta</a> is <a href="http://www.zooatlanta.org/site/the_animals/exhibits/asian_forest.html">home</a> to <a href="http://www.zooatlanta.org/site/the_animals/giant_panda_info.html">two giant pandas</a>, <a href="http://www.zooatlanta.org/site/the_animals/meet_the_stars/lun_lun.htm">Lun Lun and Yang Yang</a>.  Lun Lun is an avid climber who enjoys playing throughout the day, while Yang Yang is playful and easygoing.

They are both nearly seven years old and together eat about 220 pounds of bamboo a day.  The zoo relies on bamboo <a href="http://www.zooatlanta.org/site/support_us/helpfeed_pandas.html">donated from private lands</a> to feed Lun Lun and Yang Yang.  The zoo uses their own team to harvest the bamboo, but I think it would be more interesting if they simply took the pandas out to graze at the site.  

Of notable interest is that the zoo has <a href="http://www.zooatlanta.org/site/the_animals/exhibits/panda_cam.html">a webcam of the pandas</a>, available from 10am to 5pm (EST) Tuesday through Friday.  Of course you can guess what they spend most of the day doing.

Only three zoos in the US have pandas: <a href="http://www.zooatlanta.org">Zoo Atlanta</a>, <a href="http://www.sandiegozoo.org/">The San Diego Zoo</a>, and <a href="http://nationalzoo.si.edu/">The National Zoo</a>.  Both of these latter zoos also have panda cams: <a href="http://www.sandiegozoo.org/pandas/pandacam/index.html">San Diego</a> and <a href="http://nationalzoo.si.edu/Animals/GiantPandas/">The National Zoo</a>.
