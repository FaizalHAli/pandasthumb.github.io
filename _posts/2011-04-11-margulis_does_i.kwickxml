We all know of once-respected scientists who ended up going off the deep end, adhering to an unproven idea despite massive evidence to the contrary. Linus Pauling and <url href="http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/pauling.html">his advocacy of megadoses of Vitamin C</url>, or Peter Duesberg's descent into HIV denial. It's all the more disappointing when the one taking a dive is a woman, since there are, compared to men, relatively fewer female "big names" in the sciences. So when one goes from views that were outside of the mainstream (but later proven largely correct) to complete science denialism, it makes it all the more depressing. Even worse, mainstream popular science magazines like Scientific American (with this article by <url href="http://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v296/n5/full/scientificamerican0507-52.html">Peter Duesberg</url>) and Discover (<url href="http://discovermagazine.com/2008/jun/15-aids-dissident-seeks-redemption-and-a-cure-for-cancer">Duesberg again</url>) give these ideas reputable press. And now Discover has done it again by giving "maverick" biologist Lynn Margulis a profile in <url href="http://discover.coverleaf.com/discovermagazine/201104?pg=68#pg68">their latest issue.</url> More over at <url href="http://scienceblogs.com/aetiology/2011/04/margulis_does_it_again.php#more">Aetiology</url>.
