Supreme Court nominee Harriet Miers has 
<quote>given 10 percent to 12 percent of her earnings -- "if not more" -- to the evangelical Valley View Christian Church in Dallas, where she has been a congregant for about 25 years</quote>
according to Judge Nathan Hecht of the Texas Supreme Court, who has dated Miers.  This <url href="http://www.newsday.com/news/politics/wire/sns-ap-miers-shrinking-wealth,0,3526835.story?coll=sns-ap-politics-headlines">Newsday article</url> has the details.

What has this to do with Panda's Thumb?  A lot!

It so happens that the <url href="http://www.vvcc.org/coollinks.asp">"Useful Links"</url> page for Miers's Valley View Christian Church links prominently to the <url href="http://www.creationevidence.org/cemframes.html">Creation Evidence Museum</url>, run by Dr. Carl Baugh, a creationist who is so far out as to have been <url href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/paluxy/whatbau.html">strongly criticized by Answers in Genesis and the Creation Science Foundation</url>.  Baugh is perhaps most famous for his <url href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/paluxy/retrack.html">fakey "Paluxy Mantrack" footprints</url>, specifically the "Burdick Print," and his <url href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/paluxy/nbc.html">fossilized human finger</url>.

A YEC on the Supreme Court?  Connect the dots, people ... connect the dots.
