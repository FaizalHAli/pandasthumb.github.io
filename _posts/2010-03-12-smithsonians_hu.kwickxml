The Smithsonian Institution has launched a <a href="http://humanorigins.si.edu/">new web site</a> focused on human origins.  It includes a good deal of material on <a href="http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence">the evidence</a> (behavior, fossils, genetics, and dating) and <a href="http://humanorigins.si.edu/research">Smithsonian's research projects</a>, along with what looks like a very useful set of <a href="http://humanorigins.si.edu/education">education resources</a> including lesson plans for teachers, a teachers forum, and student resources including an interactive <a href="http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/mystery-skull-interactive">mystery skull interactive exercise</a> (I had trouble with that in Chrome but not in Firefox; apparently there's a Flash glitch in the interaction of the site with Chrome).

And just to stir the pot a little, the page on the <a href="http://humanorigins.si.edu/about/bsic">Broader Social Impacts Committee</a> will provide some fuel to the accommodationist/hardliner feud.  In particular, notice who is <i>not</i> represented on it.

At any rate, I strongly commend the site to your attention.
