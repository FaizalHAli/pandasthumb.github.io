With any tavern, one can expect that certain things that get said are out-of-place. But there is one place where almost any saying or scribble can find a home: <i>the bathroom wall</i>. This is where random thoughts and oddments that don't follow the other entries at the Panda's Thumb wind up. As with most bathroom walls, expect to sort through a lot of oyster guts before you locate any pearls of wisdom.
