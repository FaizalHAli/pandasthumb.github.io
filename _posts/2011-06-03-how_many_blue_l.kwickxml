Uncommon Descent, for some reason, <a href="http://www.uncommondescent.com/intelligent-design/rare-mutation-produces-blue-lobster/">just posted a link</a> to <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/atlantic/blue-lobster-one-in-a-million-find-for-fisherman/article2045453/">an article</a> about a blue lobster. This isn't the first time that a blue lobster has been found, and there are even rarer <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/offbeat/2009-06-11-rare-yellow-lobster_N.htm">yellow</a> and <a href="http://www.thebostonchannel.com/r/24428786/detail.html">albino</a> variants that are known. Since there is, as the UD article points out, <a href="http://www.liveaquaria.com/product/prod_display.cfm?c=1075+1641&pcatid=1641">a trade in blue crayfish</a>, it's reasonable to assume that the blue coloration in lobsters is a heritable. All that leaves me wondering something: exactly why did the folks at Uncommon Descent decide to highlight this example? 

The UD article contains the following gem:
<blockquote>Apparently, there is a trade in blue crayfish for aquariums, but any similar trade on blue lobsters depends on finding another one, of the opposite sex.</blockquote>

Does it really? 

I didn't take a lot of time to research the genetic mechanisms underpinning lobster coloration (frankly, it's not a topic that fascinates me). I did find, however, that there's reason to suspect that the blue coloration is the result of a recessive trait (<a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/4c8ftv62tjj84hc6/">a paper I found</a> noted that a prior study had found that blue offspring only occur when two blue lobsters mate). If that's the case, does a would-be purveyor of blue lobsters really need two blue lobsters to get the business off the ground?
