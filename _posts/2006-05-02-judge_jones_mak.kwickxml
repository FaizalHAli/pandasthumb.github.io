<a href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/images/2006-05-02_Time_John_Jones_100_people_cover.jpg"><img place="left" alt="2006-05-02_Time_John_Jones_100_people_cover.jpg" src="http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/images/2006-05-02_Time_John_Jones_100_people_cover-thumb.jpg" width="100" height="131" /></a><a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1187265,00.html">Check it out</a>.  Judge Jones made <i>Time</i>'s list of 100 most influential people. Appropriately enough, he's in the "<a href="http://www.time.com/time/2006/time100/">Scientists and Thinkers</a>" category.  Since people will be <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/dover/kitzmiller_v_dover.html">reading his ruling</a> and <a href="http://www2.ncseweb.org/wp/?page_id=5">reading about the case</a> for as long as evolution vs. creationism remains an issue in public education -- which will be a good long time, just think how long it took for everyone to get used to heliocentrism -- I think this was a highly appropriate choice.

Jones's reaction is <a href="http://www.centredaily.com/mld/centredaily/news/14480518.htm">reported by the Associated Press</a>:

<blockquote>Jones' likeness is on the cover along with those of President Bush, Pope Benedict XVI and Oprah Winfrey. "I was dumbstruck," he said, but he kept the honor in perspective.

"This will pass and I will be back to the more mundane things," Jones said. "Andy Warhol said everybody gets 15 minutes of fame. ...I may be in minute 14."</blockquote>

Well, at least until the half-dozen books, the PBS documentary, and the movie come out.

Also, if you haven't seen it, have a listen to <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~pfmurphy/2006/03/judge-john-e_114308788705741338.html">this radio interview</a> that Judge Jones did with WHYY last month.
