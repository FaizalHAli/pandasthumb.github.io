It appears that <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-christian27aug27,1,7818465.story?coll=la-headlines-california">yet another creationism-related lawsuit is in the works</a>. This time, the venue is in California, and it is the Creationists who are doing the suing. Apparently, the <a href="http://www.acsi.org/web2003/default.aspx?ID=1606">Association of Christian Schools International</a> and <a href="http://www.cccsmurrieta.com/">Calvary Chapel Christian School</a> of Murietta are no longer satisfied with being able to teach their students creationism instead of real biology. Now, they also want to make sure that their students will not have to suffer the consequences of this decision, and they are suing for that "right".
