Unbelievable. <a href="http://www.evolutionnews.org/2006/04/what_nice_guys_the_are_at_the.html">The Discovery Institute says</a> that it was the <em>newly elected Dover School Board's </em>fault that the city got stuck with a million dollars in costs for losing the Dover case. Never mind the school board's initial decision to <em>violate the United States Constitution </em>by using government classrooms as pulpits for the propagation of religious beliefs. No, it was the newly elected board's fault for "keeping the policy in place" that led to the million dollars in costs.

This demagoguery has simply got to stop.
