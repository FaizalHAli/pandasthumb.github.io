In addition to the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/ColumbusSciencePub">Columbus Science Pub</a> (link is to its Facebook page) previously pimped here, there's the <a href="http://go.osu.edu/osusciencecafe">Columbus Science Cafe</a>.  This week--in fact tomorrow, Wednesday, Nov 3, at 6:30 pm--Jeff McKee will speak on "The Far Side of Evolution" using (among other things) <a href="http://www.thefarside.com/">Gary Larson's cartoons</a> as illustrations.

Jeff is a physical anthropologist in the Department of Anthropology & Department of Evolution, Ecology and Organismal Biology at The Ohio State University, a former excavator (IIRC) at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterkfontein">Sterkfontein</a>, a stalwart of <a href="http://www.ohioscience.org/">Ohio Citizens for Science</a>, and general all-around good guy.  The Cafe is at <a href="http://gatewayfilmcenter.com/parking-direction">Gateway Film Center</a> at 1550 North High Street.
