As I <url href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/10/cert.html">posted previously</url>, there is a new organization in Colorado called the Colorado Evolution Response Team, or <url href="http://www.evolutionarygenomics.com/CERT/CERT.html">CERT</url>.  James DiGregori, a founding member of CERT and a senior colleague of mine, was interviewed on NPR's <url href="http://www.kcfr.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=94">Colorado Matters</url>.  The direct link to the audio file is <url href="http://www.kcfr.org/cgi-bin/comatters/comatters_play.asx?play=2882&type=comatters.asx">here</url>.  It's an excellent interview.

In other news, if anyone wants to know who won the South Carolina State Superintendent of Education race, tough potatoes.  We will <url href="http://stevereuland.blogspot.com/2006/11/where-things-stand-with-sc-ssie-race.html">have to wait until at least next week</url> to get closure on that.  But the pro-science candidate currently has the lead, and that's encouraging.
