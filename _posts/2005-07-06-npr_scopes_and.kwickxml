The <a href="http://www.npr.org">National Public Radio</a> website now has a set of articles up giving a historical perspective on trials concerning evolution and creation.

The entry point is <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4726537">"The Scopes Monkey Trial, 80 Years Later"</a>.

The linked articles include <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4723956">"Timeline: Remembering the Scopes Monkey Trial by Noah Adams "</a>,  an audio report on <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4730645">"Echoes of Scopes Trial in Maryland by Barbara Bradley Hagerty"</a>, and a report on <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4726786">"Scopes 2: Arkansas' Creationism Trial by Jeffrey Katz"</a>.

The last article links to the <a href="http://www.antievolution.org/projects/mclean/new_site/index.htm">McLean v. Arkansas Documentation Project</a>. There is some news there: a new member of the McLean Project, Jason Wiles, is in Arkansas this summer, and is collecting various of the materials on the Project wish list. The TalkOrigins Foundation is now providing financial support for the Project. Transcription charges don't come cheap, so if you'd like to help, please use the donation button at the bottom of McLean Project main page.
