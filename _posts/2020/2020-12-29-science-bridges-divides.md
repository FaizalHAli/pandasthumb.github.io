Science bridges divides. That is the lesson enunciated by our colleagues [Nathan Lents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_H._Lents) and [Joshua Swamidass](https://swami.wustl.edu/) in the [St. Louis Post-Dispatch](https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/columnists/nathan-h-lents-and-s-joshua-swamidass-the-lesson-of-kitzmiller-science-bridges-divides/article_829435cc-154f-5940-bf26-2456da663965.html) yesterday and earlier in the [Pittsburgh Tribune-Review](https://triblive.com/opinion/nathan-lents-and-dr-s-joshua-swamidass-science-bridges-divides-for-a-better-world/) on December 18. 

The occasion? The fifteenth [anniversary](https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2020/12/where-were-you.html) of the [Dover decision](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2005/12/unconstitutiona.html) by District Court Judge John E. Jones III "that it is unconstitutional to teach ID as an alternative to evolution in a public school science classroom." December 20 has come to be known as Kitzmas, and the Panda's Thumb [article](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2005/12/unconstitutiona.html) by PZ Myers may be the [first use of that term](http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002718.html).

What is unusual about the Lents-Swamidass collaboration is that Prof. Lents is a professed atheist and Prof. Swamidass is an evangelical Christian (and indeed the proprietor of the blog [Peaceful Science](https://peacefulscience.org/) and the author of [The Genealogical Adam and Eve](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07V4TBL5Z/)). Besides their own collaboration, which has led to speaking engagements "with audiences from the 'liberal elites' at Columbia University to the 'biblically conservative' at Concordia University," they note the collaboration between Catholic biologist Kenneth Miller and "non-believer" Barbara Forrest at Dover. They further point out that, a year or so after the Dover decision, Francis Collins published his book *The Language of God*, in which Dr. Collins attempts to reconcile his Christian belief with his acceptance of evolutionary science. (We discussed *The Language of God* on Panda's Thumb [here](https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/07/francis-collins-3.html), when Dr. Collins was nominated to be director of the National Institutes of Health.)

Drs. Lents and Swamidass collaborated with Richard E. Lenski to pen a negative [review](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/363/6427/590.full) of the book *Darwin Devolves* by Michael Behe in the journal *Science* (behind a paywall, incidentally). They claim in the *Post-Dispatch* article that they are risking their reputations by collaborating with each other. That may be so, but, as an accommodationist myself, I can only support their collaboration. Atheists need to understand that some people have a need to believe in a force greater than ourselves, and fundamentalists (for want of a better, general term) need to accept the findings of modern science and develop ways to integrate them with their religious beliefs. If collaborations such as Lents-Swamidass will encourage atheists to deal better with their religious friends, and fundamentalists to deal better with the reality of science, then I am all for such collaborations.
