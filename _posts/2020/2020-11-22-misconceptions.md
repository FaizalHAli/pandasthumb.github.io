Misconceptions about evolution abound, but rather too little is said about them.  I'd like to open a discussion here, in the comments.  In the slightly longer run, we could have a series of articles about them; I'd be happy to post these on behalf of their authors.  But first, it would help to have a discussion of what are
the most important, and most misleading, misconceptions about evolution.

Another good source of information on this is the <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/origins/faqs-evolution.html">Talk Origins Archive</a> which has quite a few excellent articles.  The most widely-cited is probably Doug Theobald's outstanding "29+ Evidences of Macroevolution".  Without detracting from the great service that the TOA is providing, it has been less actively updated lately.  So having some more discussions here seems like a good idea.  Perhaps we can compile a master list of misconceptions.  Let's discuss.
