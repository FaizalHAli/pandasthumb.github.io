Sorry for the short notice, but I received this invitation from March for Science just this morning. Here is their e-mail in full:

>March For Science is partnering with [Science! The Show](https://marchforscience.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=411a4f036b04a4b0a416702e2&id=53a573c7bf&e=515ccd05e3) to bring you a night all about the science-related policies that are at stake this November. [Reserve your tickets](https://marchforscience.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=411a4f036b04a4b0a416702e2&id=a979bc80f8&e=515ccd05e3) to watch live on Twitch!

>This Wednesday, at 6:00 p.m. PT, join us for a night of comedy and science advocacy with [Dr. Gretchen Goldman](https://marchforscience.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=411a4f036b04a4b0a416702e2&id=61acc9e838&e=515ccd05e3), a research director for the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists. Dr. Goldman leads research efforts on the role of science in public policy, focusing on topics ranging from scientific integrity in government decision-making, to political interference in science-based standards on hydraulic fracturing, climate change, and chemicals.

>She will be joined by the talented [Cristela Alonzo](https://marchforscience.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=411a4f036b04a4b0a416702e2&id=21b75ce69c&e=515ccd05e3), who created and starred in eponymous ABC sitcom ‘Cristela‘, making her the first Latinx woman to write and star in her own prime time comedy. Together with policy expert [Rania Batrice](https://marchforscience.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=411a4f036b04a4b0a416702e2&id=3fc096234a&e=515ccd05e3), March For Science’s very own Senior Advisor, these three guests will help illuminate what will be on the ballot this election with the Science! The Show team for a night of conversation and laughs.

>We hope to see you there!

And so do I!
