Ed Brayton was an amazing man and one of the founders of Pandasthumb. I'm saddened to report that after a long battle with his health, he died last night. It happened a few days after [he decided to enter hospice care](https://www.patheos.com/blogs/dispatches/2020/08/10/saying-goodbye-for-the-last-time/). He died on his own terms and as peacefully as possible.

We are all grateful to have known him and been influenced by him. His voice will be missed.
