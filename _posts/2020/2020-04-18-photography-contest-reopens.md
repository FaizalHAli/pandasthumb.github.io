We are pleased to announce that the 12th annual Panda's Thumb photography contest has reopened. Owing to the long delay, we have elected to extend the entry period by approximately one week, until Monday, August 24, at 12:00 noon, Mountain Daylight Saving Time. You may find the rules [here](https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2020/06/photography-contest-xii.html).

Those who have already entered the contest have been extremely patient. We have therefore decided, consistently with the last-stated rule, to allow them each one extra entry.

As in previous years, we plan to choose a handful of finalists and ask our readers to vote for their favorites. We will post a poll on or before August 31 and display the winner on September 7.
