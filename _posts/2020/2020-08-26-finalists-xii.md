Here are the finalists of the 2020 photography contest. We received 21 photographs, all of which were excellent, as you will no doubt see during the coming months. With assistance from our wife, we chose 6 finalists and then added one rather than bite the bullet and break a tie. We display the *7* finalists below the proverbial fold. We chose the photographs more on the basis of their pictorial quality than on their scientific interest. The text, if any, was written by the photographers and lightly edited for consistency.

The finalists are presented in alphabetical order of last name. Please look through their photographs before voting for your favorite. Polling will close *Tuesday*, September 8, at approximately *8* a.m. MDT, and we will display the winner at noon that day.

Please remember that this is a photography contest, not a popularity contest, and discourage your friends from enlisting others specifically to vote for you.

<figcaption>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roseate_spoonbill">Platalea ajaja L.</a>, with young. The photographer writes, "This shot was taken at the Alligator Farm in St. Augustine, Florida.  This is a popular place (among the birds, as well as humans) because, while nestlings that fall to the surface are lost, the nests are safe from such predators as raccoons, bobcats, and snakes due to the inaccessibility of the trees’ bases.  The color is due, as in flamingos, to carotenoids in the diet.  According to Wikipedia, the roseate’s closest relative is the yellow-billed spoonbill, which is found in southeast Australia.  They do get around."</figcaption>

This sample is deep underground in a tungsten mine in Nevada, USA." </figcaption>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six-spotted_fishing_spider">Dolomedes triton</a>, six-spotted fishing spider. The photographer writes, "The six-spotted fishing spider hunts aquatic insects and even small fish. Large enough to inspire respectful handling, but they are quite shy and will hide under water to escape danger, as is shown in this staged picture, which was taken from the under-side of an aquarium. You are here looking up at a spider that is hiding under a lily pad. A minnow swims nearby."</figcaption>

This butterfly was taken at my garden in Rotherham, S. Yorksshire, UK. I noticed that the under wing of this Gatekeeper is not the same as other photos of Gatekeeper butterflies. It is sitting on an Echinacea.
