Here are the finalists of the 2020 photography contest. All of the 21 photographs were excellent, as you will no doubt see during the coming months. With assistance from our wife, we chose 6 finalists and then added one rather than bite the bullet and break a tie. We display the finalists below the proverbial fold. We chose the photographs more on the basis of their pictorial quality than on their scientific interest. The text, if any, was written by the photographers and lightly edited for consistency.

The finalists are presented in alphabetical order of last name. Please look through their photographs before voting for your favorite. Polling will close *Tuesday*, September 8, at approximately *8* a.m. MDT, and we will display the winner at noon that day.

Please remember that this is a photography contest, not a popularity contest, and discourage your friends from enlisting others specifically to vote for you.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonfly">Dragonfly</a> molting. The photographer writes, "Caught a dragonfly immediately after molting into final instar, still perched on its recently-vacated exoskeleton &ndash; there's something disconcerting with seeing how much an arthropod enlarges beyond its former body. I'm leaning towards this being a blue dasher, <i>Pachydiplax longipennis</i>, because that's the most common around here, but without coloration I couldn't confirm. The lack of coloration &ndash; in fact the near-total lack of pigmentation to the new exoskeleton &ndash; was the bit that drew my attention the most, because the wing muscles are plainly visible within."</figcaption>
