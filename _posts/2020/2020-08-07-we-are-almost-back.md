Panda's Thumb has been down since the 16th of June, owing to a hardware failure in its server machine.
Reed has been working to fix that, and I have been adapting the site to be served by Github Pages.  This
has been possible since it was already using a locally-served version of Github Pages since 2016,
in its previous configuration.
<p>

Currently most features of PT work.  The comments do not appear at the end of articles, even though
the count of the number of comments appears for each article on the front page of the site, and the
Recent Comments list appears correctly.  Current and archived posts are available.
We hope to get comments working very soon.  In the meantime,
please be patient, and watch this space.
