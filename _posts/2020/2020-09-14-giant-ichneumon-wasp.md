The photographer writes, "This large female ichneumon wasp is using her long ovipositor to drill into wood in order to lay an egg on a wood-boring sawfly larva. The smaller wasp riding her is probably a male in the genus <i>Rhysella</i>, and he appears to be mightily confused about his prospects for mating and passing on his genes."</figcaption>
