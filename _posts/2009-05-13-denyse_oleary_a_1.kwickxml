<i><b>Update at the bottom</b></i>

In the context of some flailing against theistic evolution, Denyse O'Leary has finally scraped the bottom of the barrel.  On Uncommon Descent she writes<blockquote>I just got done reading a book published in Turkey called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1897940971?ie=UTF8&tag=accessresearc-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=1789&creativeASIN=1897940971">Evolution Deceit</a>, which helps me understand why Turkey alarms many materialists - but more on that later. </blockquote>"Evolution Deceit" is by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harun_Yahya">Adnan Oktar</a>, who publishes under the name Harun Yahya and is a Turkish creationist.  It's a standard issue creationist diatribe; nothing new to see there.  That O'Leary cites it as a reason to be alarmed about Turkey is entirely appropriate, but not for the reason O'Leary wants us to believe.  In fact it's an indication that the creationist pathology infests more countries than just the U.S.

Recall that Harun Yahya is also the purported author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Atlas-Creation-1-Harun-Yahya/dp/B000U37CWQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1242242603&sr=8-1">The Atlas of Creation</a> that was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/17/science/17book.html">mailed to thousands of scientists</a> a while back.  It's also the book in which a <a href="http://sciencereligionnews.blogspot.com/2009/02/evolution-of-harun-yahyas-atlas-of.html">fly fishing lure was presented</a> as a photograph of an insect along with other obvious mistakes.  I knew the ID creationists were getting desperate for allies, but this is a new low.  Soon I expect to see Denyse wearing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burqa">a burqa</a>.

<b>Update:</b>  Larry Arnhart at <a href="http://darwinianconservatism.blogspot.com/2009/05/is-intelligent-design-theory-masonic.html">Darwinian Conservative</a> notes that <a href="http://www.uncommondescent.com/intelligent-design/interview-with-turkish-darwin-doubter-adnan-oktar/#more-6823">Denyse has now interviewed Oktar</a>.  See Arnhart's post linked above for commentary on the interview, particularly Oktar's claim that <i>intelligent design</i> is the product of a Masonic conspiracy to promote atheism and Deism.  This just gets weirder and weirder.
