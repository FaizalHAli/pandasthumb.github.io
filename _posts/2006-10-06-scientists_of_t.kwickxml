Chris Mooney's article in the November issue of <i>Seed</i> is <url href="http://www.seedmagazine.com/news/2006/10/science_2006.php">up on the <i>Seed</i> website</url>. It is about the new group <url href="http://www.sefora.org">Scientists and Engineers for America</url> (<url href="http://www.sefora.org">SEforA</url>) which made a <url href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/28/us/politics/28science.html">splash in the <i>New York Times</i></url> last week.

He also has a blog post up, "<url href="http://scienceblogs.com/intersection/2006/09/scientists_of_america_unite.php">Scientists of the World, Unite!</url>"
