On AntiEvolution.org, "midwifetoad" presents us with the following <a href="http://www.antievolution.org/cgi-bin/ikonboard/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST;f=14;t=5152;st=1500#entry104268">Challenge</a>, in response to Bill Dembski's posting at UcD where he refers to a variety of websites to 'explain' the similarities between the XVIVO rendering of Kinesin and the one found in "Expelled"... You be the judge...

Following the discovery of the kinesin in the late 1980s there were investigations into the locomotion method used for propulsion giving two models with one being an “inch worm” model and the other being the “hand over hand” model. We illustrate the hand over hand mechanism in the transport of a vesicle.

A variety of papers, micrographs, illustrations and animations with depictions of the cellular transport system of kinesin were used and are freely available on the internet. We invite you to learn more about this incredible little transport engine through the following links:
