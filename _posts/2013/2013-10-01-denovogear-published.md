Our latest paper detailing new methods in DeNovoGear [was published in
*Nature Methods* today](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.2611).

> **Abstract:** We present DeNovoGear software for analyzing de novo mutations from familial
> and somatic   tissue sequencing data. DeNovoGear uses likelihood-based error
> modeling to reduce the false positive rate of mutation discovery in exome
> analysis and fragment information to identify the parental origin of germ-line
> mutations. We used DeNovoGear on human whole-genome sequencing data to produce
> a set of predicted de novo insertion and/or deletion (indel) mutations with a
> 95% validation rate.
