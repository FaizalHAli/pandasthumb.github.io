A little more than a week ago, Mike Syvanen posted <a href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2005/08/the_last_univer.html">an article</a> on Panda's Thumb that discussed a real controversy within the field of evolutionary biology: the role of horizontal gene transfer in early evolution. Today, Paul Nelson <a href="http://www.idthefuture.com/index.php?p=734&more=1&amp;c=1&tb=1&amp;pb=1#more734">misinterpreted that article</a> in a post over on ID: The Future. The specifics of this incident have been covered in more detail both by <a href="http://evolvethought.blogspot.com/2005/09/crossing-line-hgt-and-paul-nelson.html">at Evolving Thoughts</a>, and at <a href="http://evolutionblog.blogspot.com/2005/09/nelson-on-monneynisbet.html">Evolutionblog</a>.   I'm going to look at this incident from a slightly different perspective: how it illustrates some of the communications issues that scientists are forced to face when dealing with creationists.
