So I guess DaveScot and Dembski <url href="http://www.uncommondescent.com/intelligent-design/are-there-any-anti-id-writings-that-the-pandas-thumb-wont-endorse/">didn't like</url> Mark Chu-Carroll's <url href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2007/05/behes_dreadful_new_book_a_revi_1.php">critique</url> (which I <url href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2007/05/behes_bad_math.html">linked to</url>) of Behe's usage of fitness landscape concepts in <i>The Edge of Evolution</i>.

Well, if anyone is still having trouble getting it, check out <url href="http://endogenousretrovirus.blogspot.com/2007/05/good-virus-bad-creationist.html">Good Virus, Bad Creationist</url> at the blog <url href="http://endogenousretrovirus.blogspot.com/">ERV</url>.  The reason I say it's the best Behe critique ever is the style.  L.O.L.  

PS: And watch out for ERV.  She's clearly going to run the planet someday, or at least the NIH.
