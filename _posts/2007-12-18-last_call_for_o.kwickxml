We are at the submission deadline for <i>The Open Laboratory: The Best Writing on Science Blogs 2007</i>, edited by Bora and myself.  <a href="http://openlab.wufoo.com/forms/submission-form/">Go here</a> to submit quality science blog posts from 2007 before the deadline, <b>Thursday, Dec 20th</b>.  <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2007/11/open_laboratory_2008_last_call.php">Bora has a list of the current submissions</a>, so if you seen any good posts not represented go ahead and <a href="http://openlab.wufoo.com/forms/submission-form/">submit them</a>.

We are also looking for a good poem and comic to go along with the anthology.

Judging is already underway and it is going to be a tight fit, but I think that we will get the book out before the <a href="http://scienceblogging.com/">2008 Science Blogging Conference</a>.
