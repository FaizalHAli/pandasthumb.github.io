PZ has done a <url href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2007/03/luskin_and_the.html"><b>splendid job</b></url> of disemboweling Casey Luskin's <url href="http://www.evolutionnews.org/2007/03/antiscience_activists_oppose_t.html"><b>silly screed</b></url> about my op-ed from <url href="http://www.abqtrib.com/news/2007/mar/13/commentary-intelligent-design-supporters-find-new-/"><b>yesterday's Albuquerque Tribune</b></url>.

Speaking of me, Luskin complains <quote>He says that the "creationists" are getting "sneakier,"...</quote>

But, readers of the Thumb already know this is <b>exactly</b> what's happening. This is a totally inappropriate use of <b>"</b>scare quotes<b>"</b>, and I'm calling Luskin on it.

As I discussed in <url href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2007/02/cheshire_cat_cr.html"><b>"Cheshire Cat" Creationism in New Mexico</b></url>, the very "science-y"-looking website for the  <url href="http://www.nmsciencefoundation.org/"><b>"New Mexico Science Foundation"</b></url> is simply a front for the young-earth creationists at the <url href="http://www.swcp.com/creation/"><b>Creation Science Fellowship of New Mexico (CSFNM)</b></url>.

To see why Luskin's scare quotes are silly, just take these steps:
(1) Browse the science-y-looking "New Mexico Science Foundation"<url href="http://www.nmsciencefoundation.org/"><b> website</b></url>.

(2) Copy the domain name, www.nmsciencefoundation.org, into any convenient WHOIS utility.  See that the registrant is Mark Burton, with e-mail address principlesATintegrity.com

(3) Do a Google Search for <url href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%22Mark+Burton%22+NM&btnG=Google+Search"><b>"Mark Burton" NM</b></url>, and follow the links to Burton's <url href="http://www.rges.cc/staff.htm"><b>Christian home-schooling website</b></url>, his involvement in the <url href="http://www.nmsr.org/debate_0.htm"><b>creationist debate with NMSR</b></url>, or his <url href="http://www.swcp.com/creation/news/9902.htm"><b>long-standing association with the Creation Science Fellowship of NM</b></url>.

(4) If your name is Casey Luskin, go look up the <url href="http://www.wordsmyth.net/live/home.php?script=search&matchent=Q.E.D.&matchtype=exact"><b>definition of Q.E.D.</b></url>

By the way, Luskin made no mention of my favorite point in the op-ed:
<quote>Look out for complaints that simply teaching the scientific method - testing real-world (natural) explanations - somehow denies even the possibility of a guiding intelligence above it all. <b>Science is not "atheism" just because it cannot invoke supernatural causality.</b>
</quote>

Only a few days left in the Legislative Session.  So far, so good.
