Oh no!  It's Granville Sewell again.  <a href="http://www.uncommondescent.com/intelligent-design/evolution-is-a-movie-running-backward-2/"> At Uncommon Descent</a> he has posted his 2nd law of thermodynamics argument against evolution, <i>yet again</i>.   I have twice pointed out that (<a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2010/02/evidence-that-t.html">here</a> and <a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2011/02/granville-sewel.html">here</a>) that, if true, it would prove that plants can't grow. 

Is Sewell's argument unanswerable?   No, because long before I made those posts, Sewell's argument had been thoroughly demolished <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/evolutionblog/2008/11/another_round_on_evolution_and.php">by Jason Rosenhouse</a> and <a href="http://www.talkreason.org/articles/Sewell.cfm">by Mark Perakh</a>.  Game over, even if you don't know that plants can grow.

But Granville Sewell's argument over at Uncommon Descent <i>is</i> unanswerable.  At least there ... because he has the comments turned off.
