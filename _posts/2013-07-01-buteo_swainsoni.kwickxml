<big><a href="http://identify.whatbird.com/obj/41/overview/Red-tailed_Hawk.aspx"><i>Buteo jamaicensis</i></a> -- red-tailed hawk, Boulder Valley Ranch, Colorado.  Eddie Boosey of Norfolk, England, tells me [apparently incorrectly], "It is Swainson's buzzard, <a href="http://identify.whatbird.com/obj/44/overview/Swainsons_Hawk.aspx"><i>Buteo swainsoni</i></a>. You can tell that it is a buzzard because it is called <i>Buteo</i>. In America, however, for some unknown reasons this, like your seven other buzzards, is called a hawk, so it is known as Swainson's hawk." Eddie and I are often <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/English_language">separated by a common language</a>.</big>
