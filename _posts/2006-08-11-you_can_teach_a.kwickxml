...Tricks like <url href="http://scienceblogs.com/loom/2006/08/09/an_old_dog_lives_on_inside_new.php">a dog cancer cell</url> becoming an independent pathogen and spreading through the dog population.  Drop everything and go read <url href="http://scienceblogs.com/loom/2006/08/09/an_old_dog_lives_on_inside_new.php">Carl Zimmer's post about the recent discovery of a dog cancer cell lineage that has left behind its multicellular ancestry</url>.  Rather like <url href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HeLa">HeLa cells</url>, except in the wild without human help.  If I thought that "phylum" and "phylum-level bodyplan" were inviolable, unchanging character complexes (<url href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/pt-archives/000969.html">which I don'</url>t), this example of a super-phyletic macroevolutionary change, on microevolutionary timescales, would rock my world.
