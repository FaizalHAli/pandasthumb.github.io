Well, this is so brilliant I just had to post it: <url href="http://www.someareboojums.org/blog/?p=21">Ten Questions to Ask Your History Teacher</url>, a parody of Jonathan Wells's "<url href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=mozclient&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&q=ten+questions+wells">Ten Questions to Ask Your Biology Teacher</url>", which is based on Wells's book <i>Icons of Evolution</i>, which is thoroughly dismantled <url href="http://www.ncseweb.org/icons/">here</url> and <url href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/wells/">here</url>.  <url href="http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/the_anti_revolutionists_are_coming_the_anti_revolutionists_are_coming/">HT2PZ</url>
