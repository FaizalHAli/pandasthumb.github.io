<p>Walter ReMine (an anti-evolutionist who ardently believes that "Haldane's Dilemma" is a real problem for evolution) recently updated <a href="http://creationwiki.org/Haldane%27s_dilemma">the entry for "Haldane's Dilemma" at the CreationWiki</a>. The update does not directly refer to <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/authority/2007/01/how_fast_can_evolution_work.php">my</a> <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/authority/2007/01/more_on_evolutionary_speed_lim.php">recent</a> <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/authority/2007/01/basic_concepts_measuring_fitne.php">posts</a> on the topic, but does address the points that I made. Actually, "address" is probably the wrong word - he provides a hand-waving dismissal without actually responding to any of the specific points I raised. Ordinarily, a hand-waving response isn't worth the effort needed to write a reply, but in this case the errors that ReMine makes are worth discussing simply because they provide a convenient jumping-off point for a discussion of the way evolution actually works.</p>
