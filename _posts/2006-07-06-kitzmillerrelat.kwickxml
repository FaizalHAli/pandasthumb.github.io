The <url href="http://audiovideo1.law.umt.edu/DeWolf%204-12-06/Intelligent%20Design_files/fdeflt.htm">DI's David DeWolf in April</url>, complaining about the <i>Kitzmiller</i> decision and ignoring all of the substantive points made by Judge Jones.

<url href="http://www.cupolitics.org/videos/0506/id_panel/">Joel Cracraft, Nick Matzke, Barbara Forrest, and a creationist guy</url> in February at Columbia University in February.  See especially my talk, where I give the 20-minute version of the "how I helped out in <i>Kitzmiller</i>" lecture I have given various places.

The <url href="http://www.aei.org/events/eventID.1169,filter.all/event_detail.asp">American Enterprise Institute Forum</url> that took place last October during the <i>Kitzmiller</i> case, and where TMLC attorney Richard Thompson took the DI to task for <url href="http://www.ncseweb.org/resources/news/2005/US/98_discovery_institute_and_thomas_10_23_2005.asp">changing their tune</url>.  These videos were temporarily online at CSPAN but the AEI has a permanent archive and supplemental materials.

An <url href="http://www.commonwealthclub.org/archive/06/06-04intelligentdesign-audio.html">April meeting of the San Francisco Commonwealth Club</url> with a matchup of Casey Luskin and Cornelius Hunter vs. Eugenie Scott and Eric Rothschild, with two other guys providing constant distractions.  Listen especially for Luskin's admission that ID lost big in <i>Kitzmiller</i>, and Eric Rothschild's dissection of various vague nonanswers by Cornelius Hunter.

An online "<url href="http://www.pepperlaw.com/pepper/news.cfm?ID=943.0">webinar</url>" put up by Pepper-Hamilton, the law firm that contributed major pro bono support for the <i>Kitzmiller</i> case.  Participants include Eric Rothschild, Steve Harvey, and Kenneth Miller.
