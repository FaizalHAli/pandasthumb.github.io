 Ohio Darwin Groups Enlist Help of Controversial Legal Expert

By: Staff
Discovery Institute
February 26, 2004
SEATTLE, FEB. 26 -- Ohio's pro-Darwin groups have enlisted the help of a professor known for his "far out" legal views in their effort to censor a proposed science lesson on evolution.

Earlier this week the Ohio Academy of Sciences (OAS) cited Florida State University law professor Steven Gey as the authority for its claim that the "Critical Analysis of Evolution" lesson plan being considered by the Ohio State Board of Education is "illegal." On Thursday, Gey will be the featured speaker at an event sponsored by opponents of the lesson.

"The choice of Gey merely underscores how weak the evolutionists' legal argument is," says Dr. John West, Associate Director of Discovery Institute's Center for Science and Culture. "Gey has a track record of promoting legal views that can only be called far-out." For example:


    * Gey argues that nude sunbathing should be given "constitutional protection."
    * Gey claims that "moral relativism" is a "constitutional command," and judges should "require every government action to have a primarily amoral purpose and effect."
    * Gey believes it is unconstitutional for the government to restrict even hardcore pornography, contrary to current legal precedents. He justifies this by claiming that Darwinian evolution has established the need for moral skepticism.
    * Gey insists that the current Pledge of Allegiance is unconstitutional.


According to Gey, the "Critical Analysis of Evolution" lesson plan violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment because it promotes intelligent design, which he claims is religious.

"The lesson plan doesn't teach intelligent design," responds West. "It analyzes mainstream scientific criticisms of evolutionary theory. Even if it did deal with intelligent design, it wouldn't be unconstitutional under existing Supreme Court precedent. Intelligent design is a scientific theory, and the courts have made clear that alternative scientific theories can be presented as part of a good science education."

West adds that recent law review articles in the Ohio Law Journal, the Utah Law Review, the Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy, and the Notre Dame Journal of Law, Ethics, and Public Policy all take a position contrary to the one espoused by Gey.

"The weight of legal authorities is against his view," comments West.

<quote>I received the citations from the DI, and I'm afraid I don't find anything particularly "far out" about Gey's articles. I got three documents, one of which was the DI piece reproduced above by Tom Ames, and another the list of articles written by ID sympathizers, all of which are already cited in this thread.

The third document contains the citations to Gey's "far out" law review articles, complete with the DI's characterizations of same. Here is the first one:

According to Gey, the Constitution requires the government to base all its decisions on "moral relativism." To implement this "constitutional command," Gey proposes that judges "require every government action to have a primarily amoral purpose and effect." Thus, any government laws based on moral distinctions are suspect. Gey offers nude sunbathing as one activity that should be given "constitutional protection" under his theory.

The citation given is to Steven G. Gey, Is Moral Relativism a Constitutional Command?, 70 Ind. L.J. 331 (1995). Here is how Professor Gey characterizes his own article:

In contrast to the currently dominant trend favoring government power to enforce morals, the premise of this Article is that the United States Constitution requires the government to operate under a mandate of moral relativism. This Article argues that the Constitution prohibits purely moralist legislation. This does not mean that government action may never include a moral component. To some extent, government action will always be based on notions of morality, and it would be foolish to dispute that morality enters into the decision-making processes of political policy makers. This Article makes the narrower assertion that although government operations will often coincide with some powerful political actor's concept of right and wrong, it is never permissible for government to regulate an individual's behavior if the government's primary motivation for the regulation is to enforce the moral beliefs of those who control the political process. In order to pass muster under the Constitution, government policy must be premised primarily on some rationale other than morality, such as preventing a specifically identified harm to one individual by another.

This is hardly a "far out" position, and has in fact been central to debates in legal ethics since before John Stuart Mill, whose On Liberty, given its similar subject matter, is presumably even further "far out" than Gey's article. Even undergraduate courses in constitutional law and philosophy of law discuss the issue: it's inescapable.

Gey begins his discussion with what he calls "the most notorious Supreme Court opinion approving governmental moral regulation," Bowers v. Hardwick. As we all know, the Supreme Court recently overruled Bowers on related grounds, so even if Gey's views were "far out" in 1995, they are currently the law of the land.

/> As for nude sunbathing, Gey spends a grand total of three paragraphs discussing what he initially terms a "silly and trivial" matter:

It is hardly the most monumental issue facing the nation. The key fact for present purposes is that the government rarely attempts to justify the prohibition of nude sunbathing on anything except "indecency" grounds, and the courts never ask for anything more. Most of the reported cases involve either beaches historically devoted to nude sunbathing, or arrests in isolated areas where a park ranger or policeman happened to encounter bathers who were trying to avoid other people. Given the fact that the bathers depicted in the reported cases seem to go out of their way to avoid intruding on their more modest fellow citizens -- thus eliminating the argument that conflicting liberties are at stake -- the government seems to have no reason to prohibit the nudists' behavior other than to satisfy the modest majority's desire to bring the moral equilibrium back into balance. If no other argument for the prohibition of nude sunbathing can be found, there is no reason to refrain from subjecting these government regulations to this Article's general rule. Thus, the total prohibition of unobtrusive nude sunbathing should be deemed unconstitutional.

I don't see what is so "far out" about this either. It sounds like fairly garden variety civil libertarianism to me. Gey concludes:

This Article has suggested one mechanism for implementing the constitutional command of moral relativism. This proposal would draw on the Court's existing Establishment Clause jurisprudence to require every government action to have a primarily amoral purpose and effect. Under this proposal, the government would be allowed to regulate morality only to the extent necessary to protect the moral freedom of other individuals in society. Moral motivations would not be entirely excised from the law, but political control of purportedly immoral beliefs, expression, and behavior would be permitted only if the immorality threatens some direct and particularized harm to others. Despite the superficially nihilistic overtones of this proposal, it may actually produce a more moral society than that which currently exists. A constitutional command of moral relativism would produce a structure of values that is protected from the distortions imposed by the heavy hand of government coercion and punishment. Paradoxically, collective moral relativism is the only way to ensure that a system of individual morality lives up to its claims.

If the DI "fellows" find this proposal "far out," they need to get out some more themselves. I'll have a look at the other articles when I get a chance.</quote>
