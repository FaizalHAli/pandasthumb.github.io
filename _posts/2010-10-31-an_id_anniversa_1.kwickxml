Intelligent Design Creationists have given us a number of anniversaries to observe.  For example, there's Paul Nelson's long awaited "<a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2004/03/ontogenetic-dep.html#comment-395">omnibus reply</a>" to PZ Myers' <a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2004/03/ontogenetic-dep.html">critique</a> of Nelson's "ontogenetic depth" notion, <a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2010/04/breaking-news-o.html">later amended</a> to version 2.0 (for which we're also still waiting).  And of course, there's Nelson's eternally forthcoming monograph <a href="http://www.discovery.org/p/45">On Common Descent</a> which has been hanging fire for a decade or so.

Now in another recent thread on PT <a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2010/10/the-disco-tute-1.html#comment-237619">Mike Elzinga provided a link</a> that reminds me that we missed the anniversary of a prediction from William Dembski that <a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2004/07/the-everimminen.html">Wesley Elsberry first noted in 2004</a>.  In the <a href="http://www.touchstonemag.com/archives/issue.php?id=76">July/August 2004 issue of Touchstone</a> in an article titled <a href="http://www.touchstonemag.com/archives/article.php?id=17-06-060-i">The Measure of Design</a>, Dembski made a bold prediction:<blockquote>In the next five years, molecular Darwinism--the idea that Darwinian processes can produce complex molecular structures at the subcellular level--will be dead. When that happens, evolutionary biology will experience a crisis of confidence because evolutionary biology hinges on the evolution of the right molecules. I therefore foresee a Taliban-style collapse of Darwinism in the next ten years. </blockquote>Perhaps by coincidence (or design?) I've just been reading biochemist Nick Lane's <a href="http://nick-lane.net/About%20Life%20Ascending.htm">Life Ascending: The Ten Great Inventions of Evolution</a>, recent winner of the 2010 Royal Society Prize for Science books.  In particular, Chapters 2 and 3, on the evolution of the genetic code and the evolution of photosynthesis, respectively, emphatically give the lie to Dembski's prediction.  As a result, his further prediction seems a little iffy:<blockquote>I therefore foresee a Taliban-style collapse of Darwinism in the next ten years. </blockquote>Just four years to wait for that one now.  But do try again, Bill.  You're already an official contributor to <a href="http://home.entouch.net/dmd/moreandmore.htm">The Imminent Demise of Evolution: The Longest Running Falsehood in Creationism</a>, and with another failed prediction or two you could be the record holder.

And note that <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/origins/postmonth/mar02.html#hon2">another Dembski prediction</a> from 1998's <a href="http://www.origins.org/articles/dembski_mcbook.html">Mere Creation</a>, is also way overdue:<blockquote>Intelligent design is a fledgling science. Even so, intelligent design is a fledgling of enormous promise. Many books and articles are in the pipeline. I predict that in the next five years intelligent design will be sufficiently developed to deserve funding from the National Science Foundation. (p29)</blockquote>We're now 12 years downstream from that one.  Maybe the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/04/weekinreview/04good.html?_r=1">Templeton Foundation's evaluation</a> of ID as a research program has also infected NSF.
