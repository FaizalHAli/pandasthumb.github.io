Someone named Emma kindly <a href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2005/08/more_on_the_cal.html#c45565">provided a couple of links</a> to PDF files relevant to the California creationist lawsuit. One of the links is to a <a href="http://www.acsi.org/webfiles/webitems/attachments/007875_1.%20Overview%20of%20ACSI%20Law%20Suit.pdf">propaganda piece</a> written by the <a href="http://www.acsi.org/">Association of Christian Schools International</a>, which is the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit. The second link is to a copy of the actual <a href="http://www.acsi.org/webfiles/webitems/attachments/007875_2.%20ACSI%20CA%20Complaint.pdf">complaint</a> that has been filed in the case.

The ACSI propaganda flyer is an interesting read, but I'm not going to take the time to criticise it at present. Instead, I'm going to begin by looking at the complaint, which should contain the real meat of the suit. The complaint is over one hundred pages in length, and I have found material that I'd like to comment on very early in the complaint. Since both my time and my tolerance for this type of thing are limited, it will probably take several posts over several days for me to wade through everything.
