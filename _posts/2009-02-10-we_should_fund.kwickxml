My response to <a href="http://sandefur.typepad.com/freespace/2009/02/separating-science-and-state.html">Tim Sandefur's opening entry</a> in our discussion of the pros and cons of government funding for basic science research is <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/authority/2009/02/why_its_good_for_us_to_fund_sc.php">now available At The Questionable Authority</a>. In addition, he's posted a response to some of the comments on his original post that were left <a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/02/should-governme.html">here</a> and at <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/authority/2009/02/should_the_state_pay_for_scien.php">my blog</a> in <a href="http://sandefur.typepad.com/freespace/2009/02/comments-on-my-argument-regarding-science-funding--i-got-a-few-interesting-and-thoughtful-comments-about-my-post-regarding-go.html">a separate post at his blog</a>. 

In the interests of sanity - my own- I'm going to close the comments on this post. If you want to comment, please do so at my blog. (This way, I only have to try to keep up with one comment thread.)
