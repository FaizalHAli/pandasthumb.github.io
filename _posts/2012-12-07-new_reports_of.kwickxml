<a href="http://www.reports.ncse.com/index.php/rncse/issue/view/12">Here</a>. I was especially interested in a couple of articles. One, by Lorence G and Barbara J Collins, is <a href="http://www.reports.ncse.com/index.php/rncse/article/view/184/229">More Geological Reasons Noah's Flood Did Not Happen</a> (pdf). It contains a good discussion of what "uniformitarianism" means in contemporary geology, as distinguished from its 19th century usage.

Another is from <a href="http://shapiro.bsd.uchicago.edu/">James A Shapiro</a>, University of Chicago geneticist, whose ideas about an alleged paradigm shift in evolutionary theory have been severely criticized by (among others) Jerry Coyne, also at the U of Chicago. See<blockquote><verse>

<a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2012/12/02/james-shapiro-gets-evolution-wrong-again/">James Shapiro gets evolution wrong again</a>

<a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2012/08/22/james-shapiro-goes-after-natural-selection-again-twice-on-huffpo/">James Shapiro goes after natural selection again (twice) on HuffPo</a>

<a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2012/04/07/jim-shapiro-continues-his-misguided-attack-on-neo-darwinism/">Jim Shapiro continues his misguided attack on neo-Darwinism</a>

<a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2012/08/30/larrry-moran-reviews-shapiros-anti-darwinian-book-and-another-new-anti-evolution-book-by-thomas-nagel/">Larry Moran reviews Shapiro's anti-Darwinian book; and another new anti-evolution book is about to appear</a>.) 
</verse></blockquote>Shapiro's article in the new RNCSE, however, is an attempted rebuttal of <a href="http://reports.ncse.com/index.php/rncse/article/view/125/135">Larry Moran's scathing RNCSE review</a> of Shapiro's new book, <i>Evolution: A View from the 21st Century</i>. Moran's review concluded<blockquote>Shapiro, like [Richard von] Sternberg, is widely admired in the "intelligent design" community and there's a good reason for this. This book is highly critical of old-fashioned evolutionary theory (neo-Darwinism) using many of the same silly arguments  promoted by the Fellows of the Discovery Institute's Center for Science and Culture. Those fellows are dead wrong and so is Shapiro.</blockquote>Fun times.
