For the three people who don't read <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/01/it_really_sucks_to_be_casey_lu.php">Pharyngula</a>, Ken Miller is <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/01/02/smoke-and-mirrors-whales-and-lampreys-a-guest-post-by-ken-miller/">guest-blogging on Carl Zimmer's Loom</a>, swatting Casey Luskin's latest attempts to spin the <i>Kitzmiller</i> trial testimony on irreducible complexity.

PZ feels <i>almost</i> sorry for Luskin.  I don't: I saw him hovering outside the meeting room of the Ohio State Board of Education during our wars here.  No sympathy at all on my part.

Added in edit:  All three parts of Miller's smack-down of Luskin are up on The Loom now: <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/01/02/smoke-and-mirrors-whales-and-lampreys-a-guest-post-by-ken-miller/">Part 1</a>, <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/01/03/ken-millers-guest-post-part-two/">Part 2</a>, and <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/01/04/ken-millers-final-guest-post-looking-forward/">Part 3</a>.  Part 3 is particularly interesting, with Miller looking at why Luskin is attempting to rehabilitate the ID position in the light of its epic failure in <i>Kitzmiller</i>.
