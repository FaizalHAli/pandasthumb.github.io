I find it interesting that despite several articles on the confluence of science and blogs in science magazines and journals and the establishment of blogs by many mainstream science news outlets, the AAAS's <a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/">EurekAlert!</a> refuses to grant embargo credentials to bloggers.  As Dr. Hsien Hsien Lei of <a href="http://www.geneticsandhealth.com">Genetics and Health</a> <a href="http://www.geneticsandhealth.com/2007/03/07/genetics-blogging-is-illegitimate/">was recently told</a>: 

<blockquote>
I appreciate your email, Hsien, but unfortunately, the decision must stand. Our eligibility criterion does not include writing blogs of any kind. Feel free to re-register in the future, should your writing outlets expand.
</blockquote>

Did you get that?  Blogging is a narrow outlet.  I guess AAAS doesn't think that thousands of daily readers is a broad enough audience to promote their articles.  I guess such an derision of Web 2.0 might explain why <a href="http://www.plos.org/">PLoS</a> has been successfully cutting into <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/">Science's</a> market.

How about we show <a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/">EurekAlert!</a> that there is a market out there for blog-based science news?  I suggest that all the science bloggers out there, who read this, go apply for journalist access to EurekAlert!.  Just fill out <a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/register.php">this form</a> and mention your position as a blogger.  Don't forget to leave a comment here about your experience.

<h>Update:</h>

<a href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2007/03/aaas_dismisses.html#comment-164601">In the comments</a>, Ginger Pinholster, AAAS's director of public programs, has clarified their position.  It looks like those of us with dual affiliations, e.g. scientist-bloggers, are out of luck.
