<p>In a <a href="http://www.moteworthy.com/archives/000269.html"
target="new">blog post</a>, "intelligent design" advocate Francis
Beckwith makes an argument that "intelligent design" is a movement of
growing importance, as judged by the copious attention being paid to
it, evidenced in new critical books and even this very weblog. There
is a certain ambiguity to that word, <i>importance</i>, that I think
bears examination. Does the content of "intelligent design" deliver to
us "serious arguments worth considering"? I argue that "intelligent
design" has thus far delivered nothing of its own of scientific
significance, borrows its philosophical arguments from post-modernism,
and advances a socio-political agenda that plainly endangers the
common weal.</p><br>

<p>The content of "intelligent design" has been examined in detail
in a number of critical works. The common finding is that there is
no "there there". "Intelligent design"'s advocates said that they
were going to deliver a "positive scientific research program" as
their first order of business (see the <a
href="http://www.antievolution.org/features/wedge.html"
target="new">Discovery Institute's Center for the Renewal of Science
and Culture "wedge" document</a>), but that effort died still-born.

<p>Without a basis in science, "intelligent design" advocates have
decided to settle for the "next best thing": re-write science and
deny evolution.

<p>"Intelligent design" is subset creationism. It's the same old hoary
chestnuts long used past their sell-by dates by young-earth
creationists, stripped of explicit references to God and the
bible. (Leiter's remark about <a
href="http://webapp.utexas.edu/blogs/archives/bleiter/000878.html#000878"
target="new">lawyers and PR agents</a> was right on the mark, IMO.)
Behe's "irreducible complexity" is the "what good is half a wing?"
argument updated to "what good is half a flagellum?"  Dembski's
"specified complexity" is the "evolution is too improbable" argument
with extra mathematical notation and propositional logic. Both are
strictly negative arguments against the sufficiency of evolutionary
theory to account for all the phenomena of life's history and
diversity. Saying that someone else is wrong doesn't mean that one
thereby has a theory.

<p>Does recycling long-discredited antievolutionary notions mark an
"important" contribution of "serious arguments worth considering"?  I
don't think so. (See <a
href="http://service.bfast.com/bfast/click?bfmid=2181&sourceid=29618&bfpid=0195\
157427&bfmtype=book"
target="new">Creationism's Trojan Horse: The Wedge of Intelligent
Design</a> by Barbara C. Forrest and Paul R. Gross for the definitive
documentation of the provenance of "intelligent design"
argumentation.)

<p>When "intelligent design" advocates aren't borrowing from their
intellectual forefathers, the young-earth creationists, they are
combing the work of legitimate researchers for concepts that can be
spun their way. Enter Discovery Institute Center for Science and
Culture Senior Fellow Jonathan Wells and his book, "Icons of
Evolution". This work has figured prominently in several political
altercations over science education, including Arkansas HB 2458, Ohio
state science standards, and state legislation in Missouri.  But
analysis of Wells's arguments has revealed misleading claims and
overreaching rhetoric prevail there over accuracy. (See resources at
the <a href="http://www.ncseweb.org/icons/" target="new">National
Center for Science Education</a>, <a
href="http://www.nmsr.org/iconanti.htm" target="new">New Mexicans for

target="new">TalkOrigins Archive</a>, and <a
href="http://www.evowiki.org/wiki.phtml?title=Icons_of_Evolution"
target="new">EvoWiki</a>.)

<p>What seems striking to me is that given the hype over the
intellectual firepower that supposedly drives the
ever-burgeoning-but-not-perceptibly-growing "intelligent design"
movement is that there seems to be a real dearth of novelty in what
they do. While William Dembski stresses repeatedly that intelligent
designers are "innovators" in his latest book, the "intelligent
design" advocacy community has yet to produce anything of scientific
significance on their own that withstands the slightest scrutiny.  The
very best of the "intelligent design" community's efforts are found in
Dembski's ideas, which at least are wrong in interesting ways. (That
is a relative assessment that highlights the lack of quality in
remainder of the ID literature. See <a
href="http://www.antievolution.org/people/wre/papers/eandsdembski.pdf"
target="new">this paper</a> giving an extended critique of Dembski's
ideas.)  "Intelligent design" advocates are always at their
socio-political best when manipulating the arguments provided to them
by others. Is this an "important" contribution of "serious arguments
worth considering"?  I don't think so.

<p>"Intelligent design" advocates also borrow rhetoric from each
other. Beckwith's invocation of the gathering of critics as a sign of
legitimacy for "intelligent design" is taken directly from Phillip
Johnson. I have at hand the "call for papers" from the 1997
"Naturalism, Theism, and the Scientific Enterprise" conference that
was held in Austin, Texas. I submitted a paper and presented at the
conference. This turned out to be one of the early "intelligent
design" challenge conferences, such as receive mention in the "wedge
document". Phillip Johnson gave a plenary talk, in which he pointedly
thanked the critics for their attendance, which all on its own
"legitimated the question" of "intelligent design". Never mind that
the "call for papers" did not give effective notice of the political
use to which we would be put. Never mind that we critics did not find
the arguments presented by the "intelligent design" advocates either
credible or convincing. Our failure to deliver intellectual assent was
of no concern to Phillip Johnson then, and its lack apparently
troubles Francis Beckwith to no greater degree now.

<p>But the "intelligent design" borrowers don't stop with taking
arguments from legitimate science and fringe pseudo-science.  In a
case of "strange bedfellows", this primarily right-leaning community
of moral absolutists can be found to espouse the intellectual
relativism of the left. In other words, they have re-discovered the
burnt-out light bulb of post-modernism.

<blockquote> CJ: Much has been said about the impact of our entering
the post-modern era. How do you anticipate post-modernism will impact
the debate?

<p>Phil: Well, It's already having a big effect. The world that I grew
up in was one in which a very confident rationalism dominated all of
the universities...scientific rationalism, and the thought was that
you could have a rationalism in the world of values as well, but now
the idea that there are different rationalities has taken hold. I
think it's positive, on the whole, in the sense that it focuses
attention on assumptions that people make, and there really isn't one
single kind of rational system that can combine everything in the
world. Then, where it becomes excessive is when it verges over into
nihilism or indifference ideas. Post-modernism is like a whole lot of
things: taken in the right doses, it's a healthy antidote to excessive
rationalism; taken in overdose, it poisons the mind. But you find the
notion that non-Western ways of thinking must be treated with respect,
that even ancient traditions of tribes may have their truth
value--these are healthy developments, I think, and they help open up
the universities to challenges to the dominant scientific
materialism. So yeah, it's having a big effect and I think, on the
whole, a healthy one.

<p>Here we see a straightforward utilitarian outlook on Johnson's
part: use Post-modernism as a tonic, taken as needed to justify
legitimizing arguments that seek to set aside theories with evidential
support and compel recognition of conjectures without evidential
support. It's a good way to have one's cake and eat it, too.  This
way, the benefits of the considerable intellectual obfuscation
delivered by post-modernist argumentation can be obtained without
seriously seeking to apply its tenets to the predominant outlook that
undergirds the "intelligent design" movement. It becomes a single-use
tool in the overflowing "intelligent design" chest of things borrowed
from the neighbors.

<p>I have noted before (at my presentation for CSICOP 2002) the fact
that the development of the "positive scientific research program"
expressed in the mid-1990s as a high priority for "intelligent design"
by high-level advocates (Rob Koons, William Dembski, etc.) has either
stalled or been abandoned entirely. In the absence of progress on this
front, one might have expected a retrenchment and focus being put into
bringing this critical component of the movement. Instead, the effort
of "intelligent design" advocates seems almost exclusively to be put
into non-science: socio-political action on a variety of levels. The
various socio-political activities identified in the <a
href="http://www.antievolution.org/features/wedge.html"
target="new">Discovery Institute's Center for the Renewal of Science
and Culture "wedge" document</a> characterize what the DI CSC's
fellows have been doing during this period of crisis for "intelligent
design". Far from recognizing the scientific pauperage of their
endeavor, "intelligent design" advocates have intensified the
socio-political activity in an effort to perform recruitment of
students to their cause (Dembski, 2004). "Intelligent design"
advocates have been active in antievolution efforts at the class,
school, school board, state legislature, and congressional levels over
the last several years. Within the past year alone, these activities
have affected the states of Ohio, West Virginia, Michigan, Minnesota,
Texas, Arkansas, Alabama, and Georgia. </p>

<p>Are these efforts aimed at improving science instruction? I don't
think so. The puffery and spin utilized by "intelligent design"
advocates attempts, though, to paint themselves as plucky populist
champions of fairness fighting the good fight against the forces of
Evil. (And I use "Evil" here advisedly.  It is a commonplace for
"intelligent design" advocates to demonize critics as analogous to
Nazis or Soviet communists.  See this <a
href="http://www.antievolution.org/cgi-bin/ikonboard/ikonboard.cgi?s=406977b941\
3fffff;act=ST;f=9;t=1"
target="new">thread on "invidious comparisons" at the
Antievolution.org discussion board</a>.) The "intelligent design"
concepts of evolution-denial are clearly aimed at denigration of
evolutionary biology, and not a considered examination of actual "hot
topics" within the evolutionary biology community.

<p>The "intelligent design" movement's insistence on re-writing the
very definition of science (as witnessed in wrangling over the wording
of various state science standard definitions) is not intended for the
purpose of clarifying to students how science can be a coherent
discipline with a fruitful epistemology, but rather simply provides a
back-door for the inclusion of "logical possibilities" as having
scientific standing without hope of empirical inquiry deciding upon
their truth or falsehood. (Such flabby slogans as "pursuit of the
logic of the phenomena" can be seen in the <a
href="http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=2cDbb.2047%24k74.632%40lakeread05&oe\
=UTF-8&output=gplain"
target="new">online writings</a> of some "intelligent design"
advocates.)

<p>This fundamental break with the successful practice of science is a
blueprint for failure. Our students suffer so many handicaps in
obtaining a coherent education in science topics already that the
additional obfuscatory burden of the "intelligent design" definitions
are certain to drive even more students away from science to fields
that still make some sense. Those students who must bear the burden of
these revised and plainly worthless definitions get to learn the
lesson of history again that was learned first by the predominantly
theistic scientific practitioners of the 18th and 19th centuries.
They learned that a modest methodological naturalism resulted in a
vibrant and productive scientific community. They certainly cannot be
credibly accused of embracing philosophical naturalism. Unfortunately,
it appears that the lesson did not take.

<p>In a society increasing dependent upon science and technology for
its basic economic well-being, any policy that threatens the
scientific acumen of the general populace should receive critical
attention and, if necessary, active opposition. The "intelligent
design" movement has demonstrated by its actions that it threatens
effective science instruction. It is no wonder, in this light, that
Beckwith is able to point to heightened awareness of and responses to
"intelligent design" arguments. The "importance" that is ascribed
thereby, though, isn't the "importance" of another view to be
discussed over brandy and cigars in a salon. It is the "importance" of
an elevated temperature on the body politic indicating the portent of
runaway infection. As with some diseases, an initial period of
giddiness may eventually give way to the realization that those early
symptoms were serious after all.
