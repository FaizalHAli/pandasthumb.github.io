Today is the 100th birthday of one of my greatest intellectual heroes, Jacob Bronowski, the mathematician, poet, philosopher, historian, and author of <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ascent-Man-5-set/dp/B000NDI3SK/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=dvd&qid=1200705984&sr=8-1">The Ascent of Man</a></em>. <a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/01/happy-birthday-4.html">I paid tribute to him a few years ago on the <em>Thumb</em>.</a> I also <a href="http://www.geocities.com/sande106/bronowskirev.htm">wrote about him for <em>Liberty </em>magazine.</a>
