When one goes shopping for a public relations firm, there are plenty of choices. So what are the odds, one might ask, that the Discovery Institute should just happen to select the firm of Creative Response Concepts from all the available alternatives?

<url href="http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Creative_Response_Concepts">Creative Response Concepts</url> (CRC), of course, is the PR firm that helped bring the group, "<url href="http://www.factcheck.org/article231.html">Swift Boat Vets</url> <url href="http://www.cjrdaily.org/archives/000851.asp">for Truth</url>", to national prominence in 2004 during the presidential campaign. To be fair, CRC is a large company with an extensive client list, with major corporations like AT&T in the list (Disclaimer: I own AT&T stock.). But their performance in representing AT&T is unlikely to have excited DI C<s>R</s>SC decision-makers.

CRC has been earning its pay from the DI C<s>R</s>SC this year, first in arranging the showing of the film, <i>The Privileged Planet</i>, <url href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2005/05/smithsonian_warming_to_id.html">at the Smithsonian Institution</url>, and later providing the <url href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/09/science/09cardinal.html?pagewanted=all">New York Times</url> with an op-ed piece by Cardinal Schoenborn, completing the Discovery Institute's engineering of the event.

Other CRC clients include the "Contract for America", <url href="http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Parents_Television_Council">Parents Television Council</url>, and Regnery Publishing, the firm that published Phillip Johnson's book, <i>Darwin On Trial</i>.

It turns out that when it comes to PR firms, it's a small world after all.
