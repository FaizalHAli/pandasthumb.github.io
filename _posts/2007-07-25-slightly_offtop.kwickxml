<img src="http://i165.photobucket.com/albums/u57/aetiology/513x2B06KdXL._AA240_.jpg"  hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left"/>  Many of you may remember  <a href="http://www.danicamckellar.com/">Danica McKellar</a>  from  her role as Winnie Cooper in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wonder_Years">The Wonder Years</a> in the late 1980s and early 1990s.  What you may not know is that, following the television show, McKellar attended UCLA, where she graduated <i>summa cum laude</i> with a major in mathematics (and <a href="http://www.danicamckellar.com/math/percolation.pdf">published proof</a> to boot).  Since graduation, McKellar has maintained an interest in math and science education for girls, and has been active in promoting this.  She's now also published a book on math education for middle school girls (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Math-Doesnt-Suck-Middle-School-Breaking/dp/1594630399/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/102-2362347-1757700?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1185297391&sr=8-1">Math Doesn't Suck:  How to Survive Middle-School Math Without Losing Your Mind or Breaking a Nail</a>) that comes out in early August.  For those interested, I have a review of the book up <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aetiology/2007/07/danica_mckelllars_math_doesnt.php">here</a> at Aetiology.  I also managed to snag an interview with Danica about the book and other topics, including math advocacy for girls that you can check out <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aetiology/2007/07/interview_with_math_whiz_autho.php">here.</a>
