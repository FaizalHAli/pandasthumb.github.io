The <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> had an <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2005/07/10/EDGBBDKPB81.DTL">opinion essay</a> from <i>New Scientist</i> editor James Randerson yesterday.  See "<a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2005/07/10/EDGBBDKPB81.DTL">80 years later, Scopes trial debate still alive</a>".  Yesterday, notably, was the 80th Anniversiary of the <a href="http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/scopes/scopes.htm">Scopes Trial</a>, which still informs discussion of all modern battles over evolution education -- and rightly so in my opinion.  The modern situation cannot be understood without William Jennings Bryan and his 1921-1925 anti-evolution crusade.  You think "theory, not fact" policies are new?  Well, Bryan got his crusade going a few years before the 1925 Scopes Trial.  The first antievolution law was passed in Oklahoma in 1923, followed by Bryan's home state of Florida.  1924 was a legislative off-year, but in the <i>Scopes</i> era some states took nonlegislative actions.  According to Ed Larson, <i>Trial and Error</i> (2003, p. 75):

<quote>Supplementing this legislative activity, some state and local educational boards took the initiative in moving against evolutionary teaching.  A year before the <i>Scopes</i> trial, the state Board of Education in California had directed teachers to present Darwinism "as a theory only"....</quote>

(Other action was subsequently taken by the North Carolina Board of Education, the Texas Textbook Commission (sound familiar?), and the Louisiana Superintendent of Education.)

NPR's <a href="http://www.onthemedia.org/">On the Media</a> did a <a href="http://www.onthemedia.org/">story, "Evolving Coverage"</a> yesterday on the <i>Scopes</i> media coverage -- one interesting factoid is that they rolled wire all the way down to Dayton to pipe the audio out to national radio stations.  And <i>All Things Considered</i> has a <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4723956">timeline, photo series, and story collection</a> on <i>Scopes </i> then and now.
