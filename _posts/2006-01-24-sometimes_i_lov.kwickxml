<blockquote>One historical event that has been the subject of much speculation over the decades has been the <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/GreekScience/Thuc.+2.47-55.html">Plague of Athens,</a> a mysterious outbreak that is thought to have changed the direction of the Peloponnesian War, and for which the cause still remains uncertain.  

This plague has been attributed to <a href="http://www.macalester.edu/%7Ecuffel/molecularplague.htm">bubonic plague</a>, toxic shock syndrome and/or necrotizing fasciitis due to <i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i> or <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, <i>Salmonella</i>, yellow fever, malaria, Ebola, influenza, and smallpox, to name just a few.  <a href="http://www.umm.edu/news/releases/athens.html">Typhus</a> seems to fit the description best, but it's likely that a cause will never be known with certainty.</blockquote>

Little did I know when I posted that on my old blog (just last month!)  that <a href="http://www.elsevier-international.com/journals/suppfile/flat/ijid_athens.pdf">a study had already been accepted to the International Journal of Infectious Diseases</a> suggesting that it's not typhus (caused by <i>Rickettsia prowazekii</i>), but typhoid fever (<i>Salmonella enterica</i> serovar Typhi) that appears to be the cause of the plague.
