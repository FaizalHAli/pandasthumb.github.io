According to an <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2011/mar/18/european-court-human-rights-crucifixes-allowed">article</a> in the <i>Guardian</i>, the European Court of Human Rights has reversed its own earlier decision and now says that it is lawful to display a crucifix in a state schoolroom. The earlier decision caused "uproar," so the full court reconsidered its earlier decision and concluded that the crucifix was "an essentially passive symbol." As the philosopher <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidney_Morgenbesser">Sidney Morgenbesser</a> might have said, Yeah, yeah, and a Christmas tree is just a <a href="http://www.adl.org/religion_ps_2004/teaching.asp">secular symbol</a>.

France, meanwhile, has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3531151.stm"> banned religious symbols</a> worn by students in state schools.  So here is a philosophy question: Can you both permit and prohibit religious symbols at the same time?
