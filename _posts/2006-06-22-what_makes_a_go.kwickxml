For those of you who may be unfamiliar, over at <a href="http://scienceblogs.com">Scienceblogs.com</a> they have a weekly feature:  <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/channel/ask/">Ask a Scienceblogger.</a>  Previous questions have included topics as diverse as "brain drain" and the future of the human race (you can view the archives <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/seed/scienceblogs/ask_a_scienceblogger/">here</a>).  This week's question is one that I thought might interest folks here, as I and others regularly write about science education (and how to improve it).  The question is (as noted in the title), "What makes a good science teacher?"  I have my thoughts up over at <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aetiology/2006/06/what_makes_a_good_science_teac.php">Aetiology</a>, and you can find other musings posted at <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/channel/ask/">this link</a> for the next week.
