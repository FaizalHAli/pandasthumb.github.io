One is reminded of the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eMkth8FWno">Black Knight scene</a> from Monty Python and the Holy Grail. The limbs keep being lopped off.

Stephen Meyer's "Darwin's Doubt" has taken a beating from scientists who have reviewed it. Nick Matzke (recently Ph.D.'d and on his way to postdochood in Knoxville), in <a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2013/06/meyers-hopeless-2.html">Meyer's Hopeless Monster, Part II</a>, eviscerated Meyer's understanding of phylogenetics, among other things (see also <a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2013/06/luskins-hopeles.html">Luskin's Hopeless Monster</a>). Don Prothero, in <a href="http://www.skepticblog.org/2013/08/28/stephen-meyers-fumbling-bumbling-amateur-cambrian-follies/">Stephen Meyer's Fumbling Bumbling Amateur Cambrian Follies</a> did the same to Meyer's presentation of paleontology. John Pieret has a <a href="http://dododreams.blogspot.com/2013/09/open-wide.html">list of critical reviews</a>.

The most ambitious effort is on <a href="http://www.skepticink.com/smilodonsretreat/2013/07/09/darwins-doubt-a-review/">Smilodon't Retreat</a>, the blog of an <a href="http://www.skepticink.com/smilodonsretreat/about/">anonymous scientist</a>. The reviewer is slogging through the book section by section. Eight posts are up and we're just into Chapter 1 (of 20). Go there, read, comment, and cheer the reviewer on.
