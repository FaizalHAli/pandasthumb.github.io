The <url href="http://aclupa.blogspot.com/2005/12/your-reward-for-continuing-to-read-our.html">ACLU-PA blog</url> "<url href="http://aclupa.blogspot.com/2005/12/your-reward-for-continuing-to-read-our.html">Speaking Freely</url>" is reporting that Judge Jones is probably going to hand down his decision next week.  Trust me, those ACLU guys are close to the source.

Over on the <url href="http://www2.ncseweb.org/wp/">NCSE Kitzmiller website</url>, I have finally gotten a chance to OCR and upload <url href="http://www2.ncseweb.org/wp/?p=94">Barbara Forrest's supplementary expert report</url> in the Kitzmiller case.  This document was originally filed under seal, but became public when introduced into evidence in open court.  See the <url href="http://www2.ncseweb.org/kvd/index.php?path=experts/">experts folder</url> for all expert reports.

This is important because Forrest's supplemental report was the first analysis of the <url href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/evolution_of_creationism/"><i>Pandas</i> drafts</url> and their significance -- which will, I suspect, be large, since the drafts <url href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2005/10/i_guess_id_real.html"><i>prove</i> beyond any doubt</url> that "intelligent design" really is just a legal fiction to cover creationism <url href="http://www.ncseweb.org/article.asp?category=21">just like scientists have been saying for 16 years</url>, and furthermore it is specifically the very same kind of <url href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/edwards-v-aguillard/kenyon.html">vague, evasive creationism that Dean Kenyon tried to sell the Supreme Court in 1986</url>, but that the Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional anyway in <url href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/edwards-v-aguillard.html"><i>Edwards v. Aguillard</i></url>.  In other words, the Supreme Court has already decided issue, unless a <url href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2005/11/missing_link_cd.html">mere word switcheroo</url> makes a legal difference.  But we shall see next week.

In other news, I have also <url href="http://www2.ncseweb.org/wp/?p=93">posted a few more <i>amicus</i> briefs</url> (one which Steve Fuller <url href="http://scipolicy.net/amicus-currie/fuller%20dissent.htm">does <i>not</i> support!</url>), <url href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/dover/kitzmiller_v_dover.html">TalkOrigins <i>Kitzmiller</i> page</url> now has an <url href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/dover/pf.html">HTML version of the Plaintiffs' Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law</url>, and we have some discussion at <url href="http://lquilter.net/blog/archives/2005/12/13/a-few-choice-id-quotes">Derivative Work</url> and <url href="http://www.stcynic.com/blog/archives/2005/12/interesting_items_in_dover_bri.php">from Ed Brayton</url>, who by the way is <url href="http://www.stcynic.com/blog/archives/2005/12/ed_is_selling_out.php">selling out</url>.
