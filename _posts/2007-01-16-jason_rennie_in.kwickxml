Jason Rennie of <url href="http://thesciphishow.com/">The Sci Phi Show</url>, who interviewed me <url href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/11/the_sciphi_show.html">awhile back</url>, has put his interviews of Michael Shermer (anti-ID), Salvador Cordova (YEC/ID), Michael Behe (ID), and yours truly (guess) into a <url href="http://www.podiobooks.com/podiobooks/book.php?ID=120">podiobook</url>, which is I guess is what kids are doing these days.  Rennie is evidently sympathetic to ID, but he does let his guests talk, which is nice in this case because at least the guests cover more than the standard talking points.
