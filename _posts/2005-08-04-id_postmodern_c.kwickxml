<i>(<b>Note:</b> This is the first post in the new "Evolution of Creationism" category.  Since the "intelligent design" movement <a href="http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&id=1329">actively obfuscates its creationist origins</a>, tracing the true origins of "intelligent design" is crucial to understanding what ID is really about, and to understanding the dire peril ID faces in the upcoming court case [u]<a href="http://www.ncseweb.org/resources/rncse_content/vol24/4838_design_on_trial_in_dover_penn_12_30_1899.asp">Kitzmiller v. Dover</a>[/u].)</i>

Earlier today, <a href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2005/08/wapo_on_the_pre.html">Steve Reuland</a> discussed an <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/03/AR2005080301817.html">excellent <i>Washington Post</i> essay</a> ("<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/03/AR2005080301817.html">But Is It Intelligent?</a>") making the connection between the <a href="http://www.discovery.org/csc/">Intelligent Design Creationism</a> and <a href="http://www.elsewhere.org/cgi-bin/postmodern/">postmodernism</a>. <a href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2005/08/wapo_on_the_pre.html#c41329">As discussed in the comments</a> to Steve's post, it wasn't surprising that the <i>Washington Post</i> picked up on the postmodernism connection, given that it was highlighted in the <i>Post</i>'s <a href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/pt-archives/001043.html">profile of Phillip Johnson</a> back in May 2005.

But if you are looking for slam-dunk proof that ID is just creationism in a postmodern, relativist tuxedo, look no further than <a href="http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&id=44&isFellow=true">Nancy Pearcey</a>'s interview with Phillip Johnson in the June 1990 <i>Bible-Science Newsletter</i>.*  Speaking of his upcoming book, <a href="http://www.talkdesign.org/faqs/johnson.html"><i>Darwin on Trial</i></a>, Johnson told Pearcey,

<quote>"We must not forget that the controversy over Darwinism has a sociological or political dimension.  Philosophers of science have developed a very relativist approach to knowledge claims.  It is now regarded as a commonplace in the field that there is a "sociology of knowledge" and that an intimate relationship exists between knowledge and power [sic**].  What is presented as objective knowledge is frequently an ideology that serves the interests of some powerful group.  The curious thing is that the sociology-of-knowledge approach has not yet been applied to Darwinism.  That is basically what I do in my manuscript."

Game, set, match.

<b>Notes</b>

* NCSE just happens to have a 12-year collection of the <i>Bible-Science Newsletter</i> in its archives, stretching from 1982 to the <i>Newsletter</i>'s apparent discontinuation in 1994.  The <i>Newsletter</i> was a rabid young-earth creationist publication, full of reports on the hunt for Noah's Ark on Mt. Ararat, and alleged evidence of dinosaurs living with humans.  Young-earth creationist <a href="http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&id=44&isFellow=true">Nancy Pearcey</a> was a contributing editor to the <i>Newsletter</i> for many years, before coauthoring <a href="http://www.ncseweb.org/article.asp?category=21"><i>Of Pandas and People</i></a> and <a href="http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&id=44&isFellow=true">joining the Discovery Institute ID program</a>.  

Believe it or not, this Phillip Johnson quote doesn't even scratch the surface of the wealth of proto-ID material that was published in the <i>Bible-Science Newsletter</i> between 1982 and 1994.  Stay tuned to PT for more revelations.

** In the original, it appears that a word was accidentally left in or out of this sentence.  Probably it should read, "It is now regarded as commonplace..." or "It is now regarded as a commonplace observation..."
