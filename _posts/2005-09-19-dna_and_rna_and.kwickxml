PZ Myers has, over at <a href="http://pharyngula.org">Pharyngula</a>, <a href="http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/timothy_birdnow/">taken issue with</a> a <a href="http://www.americanthinker.com/articles.php?article_id=4776">remarkably ignorant essay</a> written by Timothy Birdnow. Birdnow has responded with <a href="http://cmbirdblog.blogspot.com/">a new blog</a>, PZ has <a href="http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/dance_birdnow_dance/">responded</a> to part of the response, and so the fun begins. At the risk of being seen as just piling on to an easy target, there are a couple of important points that I don't think have been raised yet. The first has to do with exactly what constitutes the "building blocks of life"; the second has to do with basic competence.
