My friend and colleague at Berkeley Laurel Barchas has entered the blogging world with a <a href="http://freethoughtblogs.com/dispatches/2012/10/08/stem-cells-in-the-2012-presidential-election/">post at Ed Brayton's Dispatches from the Culture Wars</a>.  We mostly follow the creation/evolution fight here at PT, but the battles over things like climate change and stem cells seem to have become similarly politicized and religious-ized in recent years. And proponents of good science will sometimes get flack over it, as Laurel <a href="http://john-brandtsblog.blogspot.com/2010/08/warning-high-school-stem-cell.html">found out here</a> (random example, although that guy spelled Berkeley as Berkely).

Laurel got in the game early on stem cell policy in California several years ago, and she is the Director of Academic Outreach for the <a href="http://www.genpol.org/">Genetics Policy Institute</a>, which is advertising the <a href="http://worldstemcellsummit.com/">World Stem Cell Summit</a> in December in Florida.  <a href="http://freethoughtblogs.com/dispatches/2012/10/08/stem-cells-in-the-2012-presidential-election/">See her post for an update</a>.

Meanwhile, science rolls on, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/09/health/research/cloning-and-stem-cell-discoveries-earn-nobel-prize-in-medicine.html">with a Nobel Prize today going for important discoveries in the history of stem cell research</a>.
