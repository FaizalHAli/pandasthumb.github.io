A few days ago <a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2010/04/an-id-anniversa.html">I teased another upcoming ID anniversary</a>. It's Paul Nelson Day, the anniversary of Nelson's so far unfulfilled  promise to provide a detailed exposition of "ontogenetic depth."  <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/happy_monkey_paul_nelson_its_b.php">PZ has the details on Pharyngula</a>.

Added in edit: <a href="http://blog.jmlynch.org/2010/04/07/happy-paul-nelson-day/">John Lynch also notes the anniversary</a>, and points out that Nelson <a href="http://www.evolutionnews.org/2010/04/a_puzzle_on_the_eve_of_paul_ne.html">is aware of it</a>.  Nelson also provides the toy model that he thinks shows that developmental biologists are incapable of accounting for cell differentiation.  Nelson's misconception is encapsulated in this sentence:<blockquote>We need to know the minimal instruction (or command) set, which must be present in the starting cell, for this to happen reliably.</blockquote>
