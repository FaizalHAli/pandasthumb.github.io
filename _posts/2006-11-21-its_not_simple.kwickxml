As many of the <a href="http://scienceblogs.com">Sciencebloggers</a> have already mentioned, Casey Luskin of the Discovery Institute is up to his usual stupidity. In this particular instance, <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/loom/2006/11/13/getting_the_mooney_treatment.php">he's attempting, in a typically inept fashion, to fisk Carl Zimmer's</a> <a href="http://www7.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0611/feature4/">recent article in National Geographic</a>. So far, I haven't chimed in, mostly because everyone else has done such a good job that there wasn't much to add. 

Today, though, <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/chaoticutopia/2006/11/puzzling_at_a_simpleminded_cre.php">Karmen pointed out a passage</a> that I'd somehow missed the first time I read Luskin's piece. In <a href="http://www.evolutionnews.org/2006/11/evolution_nat_geo_1.html">the first part</a> of his "rebuttal," Luskin wrote:
<blockquote>The article called evolution a "simple" process. In our experience, does a "simple" process generate the type of vast complexity found throughout biology?</blockquote>
<a href="http://scienceblogs.com/chaoticutopia/2006/11/puzzling_at_a_simpleminded_cre.php">Karmen</a> and <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/11/i_should_have_kept_reading.php">PZ</a> have both already pointed out the silliness of claiming that simple processes can't lead to complex results. I'm going to talk about something different, but every bit as silly: the idea that evolution is a <em>simple</em> process.
