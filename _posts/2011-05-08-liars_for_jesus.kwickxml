After <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/chris-rodda/do-well-by-doing-good_b_858148.html">watching an episode of the Jon Stewart show</a>, a frustrated <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/chris-rodda">Chris Rodda</a> has decided to make her book <a href="http://www.liarsforjesus.com/">Liars for Jesus</a> available free as a <a href="http://www.liarsforjesus.com/downloads/LFJ_FINAL.pdf">pdf file</a>. Ms. Rodda is senior research director for the <a href="http://www.militaryreligiousfreedom.org/">Military Religious Freedom Foundation</a>, which I recently discussed  <a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2011/03/right-wing-fund.html">here</a>.
