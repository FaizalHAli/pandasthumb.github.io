We've all heard the Creationist refrain (also a Dennis Miller joke), "If humans evolved from Monkeys, Why are there still Monkeys?"

See http://our.homewithgod.com/whereeaglesdare/darwin.htm for a badly spelled example:
<quote>Darwin claims that because we are similar to monkeys in some ways, then we must have evolved from them. So whay are there still monkeys around then?</quote>

This aphorism is also discussed <a href="http://wiki.cotch.net/index.php/If_we're_descended_from_apes,_why_are_there_still_apes_around%3F">here</a>, <a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/ev_noway.htm#11">here</a>, <a href="http://www.answersingenesis.org/Home/Area/faq/dont_use.asp#apes">here</a>, <a href="http://www.straightdope.com/mailbag/mevolution.html">here</a>, <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/library/faq/cat03.html">here</a>,  and most bizarrely <a href="http://www.vibrani.com/cloning.htm">here</a>.

As a Friday Treat, I'm posting a Torte and a Re-Torte about this curious argument.
