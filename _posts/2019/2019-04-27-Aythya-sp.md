<figcaption>These seem to be a pair of scaups, but I have not the foggiest idea whether lesser scaup,
<a href="https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Lesser_Scaup/"><i>Aythya affinis</i></a>, or greater scaup, <a href="https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/greater_scaup"><i>A. marila</i></a>. To my eye the <a href="https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Greater_Scaup/species-compare/63896301">markings are the same</a>, right down to the black mark on the nose. Hard to tell their size, but probably smaller than mallards. Boulder is on the edge of both their ranges. The photograph was taken at Wonderland Lake. If anyone can identify them, I will gladly change the title.
