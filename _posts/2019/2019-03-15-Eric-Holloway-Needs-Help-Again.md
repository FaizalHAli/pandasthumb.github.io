Eric Holloway just made a dramatic announcement on The Skeptical Zone, in Dieb's thread on the number of posts at the ID site Uncommon Descent.  In <a href="http://theskepticalzone.com/wp/posts-at-uncommon-descent/comment-page-1/#comment-248050"><strong>this comment</strong></a> he concludes
"At least in my personal interactions with people, it seems like ID has won the debate.

https://uncommondescent.com/evolution/eric-holloway-atheists-agnostics-more-skeptical-of-evolution-now/"

The link is to a post by him at Uncommon Descent which says that in his personal conversations with "atheists and agnostics" many of them agree with him that they evolution cannot explain consciousness.  Then he goes on to announce his own "magazine" that will discuss that.  That's all.  No mention of the mathematical arguments that Holloway and his co-thinkers have been making that purport to show that evolutionary mechanisms cannot account for new information getting into the genome.

Now Holloway has done this at least twice before -- announced that there is no sensible counter-argument to his arguments
