Eric Holloway just made a dramatic announcement on The Skeptical Zone, in Dieb's thread on the number of posts at the ID site Uncommon Descent.  In <a href="http://theskepticalzone.com/wp/posts-at-uncommon-descent/comment-page-1/#comment-248050"><strong>this comment</strong></a> he concludes
"At least in my personal interactions with people, it seems like ID has won the debate.

https://uncommondescent.com/evolution/eric-holloway-atheists-agnostics-more-skeptical-of-evolution-now/"

The link is to a post by "News" (Denyse O'Leary) at Uncommon Descent which quotes from <a href="https://www.patheos.com/blogs/eidos/2019/01/a-new-journal-for-constantinean-techies/"><strong>a post at a blog called Eidos</strong></a>, where Holloway says that in his personal conversations with "atheists and agnostics" many of them agree with him that they evolution cannot explain consciousness.  Then he goes on to announce his own "journal" that will discuss that.  That's all.  No mention of the mathematical arguments that Holloway and his co-thinkers have been making that purport to show that evolutionary mechanisms cannot account for new information getting into the genome.

Now Holloway has done this at least twice before -- announced that there is no sensible counter-argument to his arguments.  In fact, I've commented on it here <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2018/11/Eric-Holloway-needs-our-help.html"><strong>in a post last November</strong></a>.  There I noted a 2018 statement he made <a href="https://mindmatters.ai/2018/10/does-information-theory-support-design-in-nature/"><strong>at the Discovery Institute's "Mind Matters" site</strong></a> about there being no counterarguments to information-theory based arguments for ID.  In my PT post in Novmber I gave extensive links to the detailed refutations that have appeared here and at TSZ for those arguments.  I also pointed out that he did this once before, in 2011, about William Dembski's No Free Lunch argument.  As I noted, with links, it had been knocked down thoroughly by 7 people soon after it appeared.  But somehow those was invisible to Holloway!

What about Holloway's latest arguments?  Let me comment briefly below ...

<!--more-->

In recent months, Holloway has presented arguments that there is a mutual-information conservation law showing that a function applied to algorithmic complexity cannot increase the amount of Algorithmic Specified Complexity in a genome.  The strong implication was that this somehow showed that natural selection could not put Sepcified Complxity into genomes.
I and others have asked for clarification of this.  How does this work?  Why is Algorithmic Specified Information, a measure of the unusual simplicity of an algorithm, relevant to fitness or adaptation?  How does it refute simple population genetics calculations, that show that highly-fit genotypes can increase greatly in frequency in a population?
But alas, Holloway never engaged with these issues.

Now he is again making declarations that ID is winning, but the ID arguments he has in mind are about why consciousness cannot arise from evolutionary processes.  I am not going to argue with him here -- that would involve a careful consideration of consciousness in animals, for example.  But I do want to point out the likelihood that if people do engage with that topic, they may be disappointed and find that Holloway has absented himself, gone somewhere else, and, of course, declared that there are no sensible arguments against his position.

I have opened this discussion here, to allow the denizens of The Skeptical Zone to concentrate their bandwidth on the theological topics (such as Bayesian arguments about the Resurrection) and philosophical topics (such why we know what we know) that are their main concern.

<em>I will be "pa-trolling" this thread and will delete comments by trolls who try to divert discussion from the topic</em>.
