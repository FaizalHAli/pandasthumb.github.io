Our occasional contributor (and my sometime pen pal) David MacMillan has written a <a href="https://medium.com/@davidstarlingm/path-across-the-stars-e8dbf93e4405">splendid article</a> detailing his "conversion" from young-earth creationist to rational scientist. I will not give the story away, but Mr. MacMillan seeks answers from distinguished "creation scientists" and accepts complex rationalizations, until he sees an event the obviously took much, much longer than 6000 years to unfold.
