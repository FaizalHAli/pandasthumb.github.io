Here are the finalists of the 2019 photography contest. We received 15 photographs from 5 photographers. All of the pictures were excellent, as you will no doubt see during the coming months. With assistance from our wife, we chose 1 photograph by each photographer and display them below the proverbial fold. We chose the photographs more on the basis of their pictorial quality than on their scientific interest. The text, if any, was written by the photographers and lightly edited for consistency.

The finalists are presented in alphabetical order of last name. Please look through their photographs before voting for your favorite. Polling will close Friday, July 8, at approximately 9 a.m. MDT, and we will display the winner at noon that day.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonfly">Dragonfly</a> molting." The photographer writes, "Caught a dragonfly immediately after molting into final instar, still perched on its recently-vacated exoskeleton - there's something disconcerting with seeing how much an arthropod enlarges beyond its former body. I'm leaning towards this being a blue dasher, <i>Pachydiplax longipennis</i>, because that's the most common around here, but without coloration I couldn't confirm. The lack of coloration - in fact the near-total lack of pigmentation to the new exoskeleton - was the bit that drew my attention the most, because the wing muscles are plainly visible within."</figcaption>

<figcaption>
<a href="http://reptile-database.reptarium.cz/species?genus=Ptyodactylus&species=guttatus"><i>Ptyodactylus guttatus HEYDEN, 1827</i></a> &ndash; Sinai fan-fingered gecko, probably a female. The photographer writes, "What I personally like most about the picture (and what you cannot really see on the image) is the location where I took it. The gecko sits on some of the stone tracery on the outside of the Chapel of Ascension on the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem. The red dots at the hip of the individual are parasitic mites, full of gecko blood."</figcaption>

American rubyspot damselflies, by **Mark Sturtevant**.

<figcaption>
<a href="https://www.odonatacentral.org/index.php/FieldGuideAction.get/id/42272"><i>Hetaerina americana</i></a> &ndash; American rubyspot damselflies. The photographer writes, "These lay their eggs in rivers and streams, and like other damselflies and the related dragonflies, their immature stage is spent in water. Here, a female is eating another damselfly that had just emerged from the water as an adult. It is easy to forget that these delicate and beautiful insects are dedicated predators. A male rubyspot stands guard in the background in this scene. Males defend these sorts of territories against rival males by using their bright red colors as an aggressive display. Females generally mate with males that ‘own’ a desirable territory. The river in the background is the Flint river, and this picture was taken near Flint Michigan. Although the situation with Flint and its river has considerable notoriety these days, it should be said that the river itself is teeming with life."</figcaption>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adalia_bipunctata"><i>Adalia bipunctata</i></a> &ndash; two-spotted ladybird. The photographer writes, "This photograph could be titled 'proof of the pudding, down the hatch.' It is proof that the ladybird beetle eats aphids. It was taken way back in 2010 in the shops car park, Rotherham, S. Yorkshire." She adds, "I would like to say the aphid is a rose aphid but I'm not sure; there are a lot of types of <a href="http://influentialpoints.com/Gallery/Aphid_genera.htm">aphid</a>."</figcaption>
