<b>UPDATE: I just found out this event has been cancelled at the last minute.  So don't come.  I will, however, still be around all week and attending other Darwin Day events until the 11th.</b>

I just wanted to let PT readers across the pond in England know that I am zipping over there for a Darwin Day talk this coming Sunday, February 5th, in Shrewsbury.  The details are <url href="http://www.ncseweb.org/meeting.asp">here</url>, and used to be <url href="http://www.darwinshrewsbury.org/events">here</url> but have been dropped for some reason.  Actually, I am speaking a week before Darwin Day, and they appear to have a <url href="http://www.darwinshrewsbury.org/events">whole series</url> of events planned.

Naturally, I will be talking about the <i>Kitzmiller</i> case and in particular <url href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2005/10/i_guess_id_real.html">how we discovered the "smoking gun"</url> tying ID to creation science.  Following my talk will be a, um, unique musical event (see description).

Shrewsbury appears to be gearing up for a massive DarwinFest in 2009, the 150th anniversiary of the <i>Origin of Species</i>.  They are not paying me or anything, but I do get to spend the whole week running around on a Darwin tour recommended by my host Mark Pallen, who among other things is a <url href="http://www.infection.bham.ac.uk/BPAG/staff/mpallen.html">Type III secretion researcher</url>, bioninformatics specialist, and a Darwin fan so crazed <url href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/west_midlands/4256303.stm">he has set the <i>Origin of Species</i> to a reggae beat</url>.  He found out about little old me when he read my <url href="http://www.talkdesign.org/faqs/flagellum_background.html">Big Flagellum Essay</url>, but that is another story for another time.

So anyway folks, make the talk if you can, or drop me an email (matzke@ncseweb.org) and we might be able to do a mini-Howlerfest at one of the local bits of Darwiniana.
