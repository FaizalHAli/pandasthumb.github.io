A nice write-up on Project Steve appeared today in <i>HERO</i>, also known as <i>Higher Education & Research Opportunities</i>.  The piece, "<a href="http://www.hero.ac.uk/sites/hero/uk/inside_he/steve_olution.cfm">Steve-olution</a>," consists of an interview with NCSE's always-erudite assistant director Glenn Branch.  If you've been living under a rock and haven't heard of <a href="http://www.ncseweb.org/article.asp?category=18">Project Steve</a>, check out <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=mozclient&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&q=site:www.pandasthumb.org+project+steve">previous Panda's Thumb posts</a> and the <a href="http://www.ncseweb.org/article.asp?category=18">NCSE Project Steve website</a>.

The <a href="http://www.ncseweb.org/resources/articles/5945_the_faqs_2_16_2003.asp">Steve-o-meter</a> currently sits at 553, in case you were wondering.  The Steve-o-meter on the much-vaunted Discovery Institute list of scientists (well, some of them aren't scientists, but who is counting?) kinda-sorta-vaguely doubting certain parts of "neo-darwinism" reads, at last count, four.
 
Even if you have heard of Project Steve, you might not have heard the <a href="http://www.ncseweb.org/resources/articles/8860_the_steve_song__3_15_2005.asp">Steve Song</a> yet.   Sort of like the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=mozclient&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&q=spam+song">Monty Python spam song</a>, but slightly different.
