A reminder that the papers in <a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/0039-7857/178/2/">the special issue of Synthese</a> edited by Glenn Branch and James A. Fetzer are available online free for just two more days, today and tomorrow.  After the 31st they disappear behind the Springer paywall.  Get 'em while they're free!
