Mary Midgley has fingered the nineteenth century philosopher Herbert Spencer as the culprit for the fundamentalist reaction against individualism in the United States, in a <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/channel/being-human/mg18424796.400">recent article</a> in <span style="font-style: italic;">New Scientist</span> (25 December 2004-1 January 2005, p. 29) entitled "On the origin of creationism".

After noting the strong Old Testament influence on early American settlers (a point first discussed, if I recall aright, at some length by <a href="http://www.marshillreview.com/reviews/bonhoeffer.shtm">Dietrich Bonhoeffer</a> during his tour of the US in the 1930s, before the Nazis had taken full control over Germany. Bonhoeffer was later hung by the SS for his involvement in the plot to kill Hitler), Midgley then says
<blockquote>A second, less well-known ingredient is the peculiar form in which evolutionary theory reached the American public. In the 1880s, the biologist and philosopher Herbert Spencer toured the US to immense acclaim, indefatigably preaching a doctrine that he claimed was Darwin's. It was actually social Darwinism, a crude application to human life of the "survival of the fittest" principle, amounting to "devil take the hindmost". Spencer regarded this principle as the driving force of evolution and hence the true guide for morals. After the tour, his works outsold those of all other philosophers in the US for a decade, and his simple-minded, competitive individualism has remained powerful there ever since.</blockquote>I am a bit nonplussed at this. Recently I picked up one of Spencer's works on politics - <span style="font-style: italic;">The Man versus the State</span> (1881, I have the 1969 Penguin edition), and it seemed to me he was neither simple minded, nor entirely individualistic, in his critique of English politics. He was clearly a Whig, or Liberal (a term Americans seem to have redefined to mean something very different than Mill or Spencer thought it meant), yes, and a <span style="font-style: italic;">laisse faire</span> economist. And there is an element of individualism in Spencer's ideas. But I wonder if it is true or fair to say either that he was a social Darwinian in the way Midgley suggests, or that he was as influential as all that in firming up the United States' urban economic ideals.<p>

America was the land of the rugged individual long before Spencer. In fact, it is arguable that there ever even <span style="font-weight: bold;">was</span> a social Darwinian movement as such. Certainly historian Robert Bannister argued that the similarity was more apparent than real and that those who are called social Darwinians are ususally just being chastised for not agreeing with the one doing the labeling. There was a social Darwinian in my view - just one, named <a href="http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/profiles/sumner.htm">William Graham Sumner</a>, an economist and political theorist at Yale, already in the US. Social Darwinism seems to be a home-grown American philosophy, which might explain why Spencer's rather less harsh philosophy was both received well there, and preferred over the local product. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Sumner</span> had a "devil take the hindmost" philosophy. Spencer did not.<p>

And is it really the case that this is what caused creationism and Christian fundamentalism, as Midgley claims? Not according to those who deal with creationism, it isn't. Ronald Numbers, in his books <span style="font-style: italic;">The Creationists</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Darwinism Comes to America</span> discusses the actual causes. One major figure who contributed to the rise of fundamentalism, George Wright, is likely, thinks Numbers, to have become a fundamentalist because he was reacting to the rise of Higher Criticism, a movement that <span style="font-weight: bold;">did</span> come from England to America (although of course it was a European, largely German, invention). Similarly, fundamentalism arises in the South more than the North, and it appears to have a single major feature - a reaction against the modern world.<p>

You don't need to posit a special influence from Darwinism (social or otherwise) or any other single aspect of the modern world - it is modernism itself for which literalism and fundamentalism are invented to deal with.<p>

A friend, Mike Syvanen, once suggested that the reason cults share such obviously false ideas is that they insulate the followers against the rest of the world. Creationists can only talk to other creationists, and so it reinforces the solidarity of the community. In terms of the social evolution I favour, creationism is a fitter belief in the density-dependent selection of ideas than openness to science. this makes a kind of sense, I think - given the use of ideas to generate social identity, and the fact that a certain percentage of folks are going to be less adaptable to changes in society than others, something like antimodernism is going to generate things like creationism without any boost from a specific source like Spencer.<p>

So, is creationism a postmodernism? This is not an easy question to answer in part because the nature of postmodernisms is to evade definition. But creationism is definitely an anti-modernism - it fears the modern world. As such it is in the same intellectual class as the Taliban form of Islam, Luddism, and any view of the world that rejects change <span style="font-style: italic;">qua</span> change.<p>

However, what is "modernism"? It was, so far as I can see, never more than, an architectural or esthetic style. Sure, modernist style spilled out into the arts, urban design, and so forth, and was founded on a naive progressivism, but it was not a full philosophical statement of the modern world or of science. Postmodernism began, I suppose, on the assumption that buildings and styles need to be livable. It very quickly became, to my eyes, a sheltered workshop for intellectuals who did not want to engage science.<p>

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmodernism">What is postmodernism</a> that we must discuss it? Is it anything that quotes Derrida? Can we quote Foucault? I have a lot of time for Foucault, at least his early stuff like <span style="font-style: italic;">The Order of Things</span> - but the problem with postmodern style is not the interminable terminology, making it so hard to see what the <span style="font-weight: bold;">point</span> is and so easy to parody as <a href="http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/">Alan Sokal</a> did. The problem is one of <span style="font-weight: bold;">validation</span>.<p>

Back when I was a theology student, I studied existentialism in some detail, a philosophical precursor to postmodernism. I recall thinking then that existentialism was like painting trees. Some painted austere oaks, like Nietzsche. Some painted baroque forests, like Kierkegaard. Some painted dead trees and called them noble, like Sartre. Some had birds, some had vultures and some were empty of life or leaves.<p>

Each of them was a work of art. But I was left unable to decide, on the basis of what they painted, if I could find shade underneath these trees, or better, climb them to see where I was. In fact, I was not sure if those trees or anything remotely like them <span style="font-weight: bold;">existed</span>.<p>

The purpose of art, I suppose, is not to paint things as they are, but as they ought to be, esthetically. But the purpose of philosophy is to show things as they are and suggest a way to deal with them. So I very early on turned to analytic philosophy, as a way to test the often outlandish claims made by that style of philosophical art.<p>

Of course, for a long time analytic philosophy was the analysis of ordinary language and concepts, as if refining confusion and folk science would lead us anywhere. So I turned rapidly to the analysis of science, which at least had the virtue of actually testing claims about trees. Hence my shift to the philosophy of science, and in particular of biology.<p>

And that brings us back, full circle, to creationism. They fear the modern because the modern is not what they automatically believe. It takes work to learn the modern, and effort to divest oneself of the naive epistemology of our heritage as apes. We did not evolve to apprehend reality; we evolved to apprehend our fellows and that much of reality we needed to deal with to live. So challenges to our basic human nature (yes, Virginia, there <span style="font-weight: bold;">is</span> a human nature, of sorts) elicit a savage reaction from some.<p>

And it is not that they are savage because they are dumb, or because they are reacting to social Darwinism or whatever. They react to the <span style="font-weight: bold;">difference</span> between what we naively believe and what science has developed. Some proportion of any human population will fear that change, just as a matter of statistical distributions of traits.<p>

This leads to an interesting conclusion - science is a way of overcoming our primate biases and limitations. How can it do this, if it is run by primate brains? Darwin wondered this about the existence of God - could a modified monkey brain draw sensible conclusions? Can it about <span style="font-weight: bold;">anything</span>?<p>

The point is that science is more than modified monkey brains. It is more like a distributed computing system that uses a portion of the connected nodes' capacity for its own tasks, and which delivers an output far greater than any single node is capable of producing. While humans are scientists, nodes in the scientific process, the process itself is not encompassed by a single individual, nor is it irrevocably biased by the biases of its nodes. Science exceeds individuals.<p>

Creationists, and anti-science advocates of any kind, fail to appreciate this. To them, science is some corpus of beliefs that an individual has to accept, the way one has to accept the tenets of capitalism or the religion of humanism or whatever is their <span style="font-style: italic;">bête noir</span>. They do not see that one can be a node in the scientific enterprise even if they do not share any beliefs with their fellows, so long as they treat evidence and inference the same way. One cannot do theology unless one accepts the core beliefs of that discipline. One can do science no matter what one believes.<p>

So the paintings of science are done with a camera obscura, which, despite its name, fairly represents the trees one is sketching and limits the biases of the painter. And moreover it can be corrected later, if mistakes are made. In postmodern and anti-modern philosophies, it is not even possible to make a mistake. There's just the painting...<p>
