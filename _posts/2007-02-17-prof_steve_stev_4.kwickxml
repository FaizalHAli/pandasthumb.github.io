<img src="http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/images/stevesteve/head.jpg" place="left" /><url href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/steve_steve/">Prof. Steve Steve</url> and his trusty sidekick Nick Matzke plan to be at the NCSE booth at the <url href="http://www.aaas.org/meetings/Annual_Meeting/">AAAS Annual Meeting</url> at the Hilton in downtown San Francisco from 10-5, Saturday, February 17.  I know many PT people and ScienceBloggers are at the meeting, so stop by and see us! (<url href="http://www.aaas.org/meetings/Annual_Meeting/03_GI/Info_03_Ground_Transpt.shtml#sfo_bart">transport info</url>) 

Prof. Steve Steve, and perhaps Nick, will also be in attendance on Sunday and Monday.  It looks like Saturday and Sunday have free Exhibit Hall admission on account of <url href="http://www.aaas.org/meetings/Annual_Meeting/02_PE/PE_11_FSD.shtml">2007 Family Science Days</url>.

As with every AAAS meeting, the true goal is to get invited to the Science Journalists' Party, which I hope is Saturday night.  They always throw quite a bash, although it will be hard to trump the molten chocolate fountain from the DC meeting a few years back.
