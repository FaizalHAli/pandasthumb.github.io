[not sure about this one -- too much like dancing on his grave?  Not my intention, but YEC is very silly stuff]

<a href="http://www.stnews.org/Commentary-2689.htm">Via <i>Science and Theology News</i></a> (where there are <a href="http://www.stnews.org/commentary.htm">a number of essays</a> commenting on the <i>Kitzmiller</i> decision -- see <a href="http://www.stnews.org/Commentary-2688.htm">Rob Pennock's especially</a>) I came across <a href="http://mooreslore.corante.com/archives/2006/03/01/the_antiscientist_and_i.php">this essay</a> by journalist Dana Blankenhorn at his blog, <a href="http://mooreslore.corante.com/">Moore's Lore</a>.  The essay is entitled, "<a href="http://mooreslore.corante.com/archives/2006/03/01/the_antiscientist_and_i.php">The Anti-Scientist And I</a>," and Blankenhorn, a graduate of Rice University, comments on the legacy of the recently deceased Henry Morris, also a Rice graduate.  Henry Morris, of course, was the coauthor of the <i>Genesis Flood</i> and the inventor of "scientific creationism," and probably the most influential creationist of the 20th-century after William Jennings Bryan. Blankenhorn's conclusion:

<quote>Few men in the 20th century did so much on behalf of confusion as Henry Morris.</quote>

It's been a few weeks, and the many obituaries and tributes to Morris have been published, so perhaps now would be a good time to have a discussion of his legacy. So that this doesn't into either platitudes or a food fight, let's take it for granted that (1) Morris was tremendously influential, that (2) he was "a real gentleman" as <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/28/AR2006022801716.html">Ed Larson put it in the <i>Washington Post</i></a>, and (3) that young earth creationism, flood geology, and scientific creationism were basically a big cosmic joke that the Seventh-Day Adventists (foundress Ellen G. White and disciple George Macready Price) played on 20th-century American evangelicalism via Henry Morris.  (If you don't believe me, read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0520083938/">this</a> or <a href="http://www.leaderu.com/ftissues/ft9304/reviews/noll.html">this</a> or <a href="http://www.counterbalance.net/history/creatrev-frame.html">this</a>).

The question I am interested in, and which it might be productive to discuss, is, <b>"Was Henry Morris Good or Bad <u>for Creationism</u>?"</b>  Reading the various commentaries by many ID advocates, I was surprised how many of them uncritically praised Morris's work and influence.  I have not yet found anyone suggesting what I think is a pretty plausible alternative -- that Henry Morris set creationism back 150 years and kept it there throughout his lifetime.  It was Henry Morris, more than anyone else, that ensured that creationism was a disreputable, dogmatic, unscientific system, with the result that anyone who wanted to be taken seriously avoided the term like the plague.  But it was also Henry Morris that spread pugnacious, defiantly ignorant young-earth creationism very widely among american evangelicals.  The result was that anyone who wanted to mount a more realistic creationist challenge to modern science was forced, for political and funding reasons, to kowtow to the most extreme and delusional elements of the creationist movement and speak no evil about the young-earth position.  While this compromise was useful within the evangelical community, it doomed any chance of creationism deserving any scientific credibility until that far-off day when YEC is regarded as wrong and a decisive testimony for the humans capaicty for sel-fdelusion.
