I finally got around to looking at the <a href="http://www.ideacenter.org/contentmgr/showdetails.php/id/1267">IDEA Center's response</a> to my <a href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/pt-archives/000625.html">call-in statement to the PowerPoint radio show in November</a>.

<quote>
I'm a theist who is a critic of the claims of "intelligent design" advocates. I'd like to focus on the claim made by Dr. Calvert that ID has theoretical content, and that the design detection methods of ID are being applied in science. Briefly, design detection in ID refers to the concept of "complex specified information" expounded by William Dembski. However, Dembski has never shown the full and successful application of his concept to any phenomenon whatsoever. No one else has, either. Dembski's design detection method is both incoherent and unworkable. It is of no value to science. This is detailed in the recent book, Why Intelligent Design Fails.

They take issue with my statement and end up agreeing that Casey Luskin was justified in saying that Dembski had applied his "design detection" apparatus. I will point out why they are just as full of crap now as Casey was in the moment that he contradicted me on the air.

First I need to make it clear that I am holding Dembski to the full "technical" standard that he himself requires of others. If someone proposes a counterexample concerning Dembski's "explanatory filter/design inference" (EF/DI), he responds by detailing where such things have not conformed to various parts of his logical or mathematical framework, such as not applying the "universal small probability" as a threshold. This is apparently difficult for ID cheerleaders to grasp, that simply asserting that something looks like CSI, therefore it is CSI is not sufficient. Dembski says that one detects CSI by doing math, so, by golly, statements that things are examples of CSI that don't come with math are simply off the table from the outset. And Dembski has given (or <i>specified</i>) the math that needs to accompany a demonstration that an event represents an instance of CSI. So, when I say that Dembski has never fully and successfully applied his apparatus to any phenomenon whatsoever, what I mean is that he has not shown his work for all the steps of his EF/DI (via his "generic chance elimination argument" or GCEA) and come up with a number that is smaller than his "universal small probability".

This point is an extreme one, and goes well beyond the context of the original radio show, where Calvert was claiming that "intelligent design" techniques were already widely deployed and doing useful work. That claim is immensely bogus. The only such "technique" in the ID arsenal is Dembski's. And, as I will demonstrate here, nobody is using Dembski's technique, not even Dembski. It has certainly not been established that anyone besides Dembski has even claimed to have published a fully worked-out example of application of Dembski's EF/DI. And when we look at Dembski's output, what we find are a string of assertions without numbers (much less any <i>calculation</i>), examination of hypotheticals (one of these cases, the <i>Contact</i> primes example), trivialities (two of these cases, the Caputo case and Dawkins's "weasel" program), and one failed attempt at analysis of a biological system.

So, let's look at the IDEA Center's defense of Dembski...

<quote>
Finally, while on the air Casey did not make anything up regarding William Dembski's work in No Free Lunch. Wesley claimed that Dembski hadn't applied his methodology. Casey simply replied that Dembski had applied his ideas. Dembski has applied his notion of complex and specified information (CSI) to the bacterial flagellum in chapter 5 of No Free Lunch where he calculates the level of CSI in the flagellum. Wesley probably thinks that none of Dembski's applications are ever "successful," and perhaps one would expect no less from such a devoted critic. But Wesley's claim against Dembski was extremely broad, as Wesley stated Dembski "has never shown the full and successful application of his concept to any phenomenon whatsoever." Such a broad claim which would seem to be refuted by the many examples which Dembski runs through the explanatory filter in his books. This includes human phenomena (election control, TDI pg. 9-20, intellectual property protection, TDI pg. 20-22; forensic science, TDI pg. 22-24; data falsification in science, TDI pg. 24-26; cryptography, pg. 26. . .) and non-human phenomena (SETI, TDI pg. 26-32; general randomness, pg 32-35; simple lifeforms, TDI pg. 55-62; the bacterial flagellum, NFL pg 279-302). In any case, whether or not Dembski can successfully apply his ideas is a matter of debate--Dembski has dealt with many problems regarding false positives, false negatives, and clearly defined his terms (see, for example, The Design Revolution, where Dembski addresses a large number of such objections). Dembski's ideas can be applied in science--we can calculate the level of CSI in a biological structure, just as Dembski does for the flagellum in ch. 5 of No Free Lunch.

(BTW, I've archived the page from 2004/12/09, and that is the one I am critiquing here. IDEA pages tend to be quite malleable, protean even.)

When it comes to enumerating claimed examples of CSI, I think the <a href="http://www.antievolution.org/people/wre/papers/eandsdembski.pdf">paper by myself and Jeff Shallit</a> is still the gold standard -- we listed twenty such cases. About the first sixteen, we said this:

<quote>

Here is a brief catalogue of some of the things Dembski has claimed exhibit CSI or "specified complexity":

1. 16-digit numbers on VISA cards, [17, p. 159]
2. phone numbers, [17, p. 159]
3. "all the numbers on our bills, credit slips and purchase orders", [17, p. 160]
4. the "sequence corresponding to a Shakespearean sonnet", [19, p. xiii]
5. Arthur Rubinstein's performance of Liszt's "Hungarian Rhapsody", [19, p. 95]
6. "Most human artifacts, from Shakespearean sonnets to Durer woodcuts to Cray supercomputers", [19, p. 207]
7. scrabble pieces spelling words, [19, pp. 172{173]
8. DNA, [19, pp. 151]
9. error-counting function in an evolution simulation, [19, p. 217]
10. a "fitness measure that gauges degree of catalytic function" [19, p. 221]
11. the "fitness function that prescribes optimal antenna performance" [19, p. 221]
12. "coordination of local fitness functions", [19, p. 222]
13. what "anthropic principles" explain in fine-tuning arguments [19, p. 144]
14. "fine-tuning of cosmological constants" [19, p. xiii]
15. what David Bohm's "quantum potentials" extract in the way of "active information"
[19, p. 144]
16. "the key feature of life that needs to be explained" [19, p. 180]

What is really remarkable about this list is both the breadth of Dembski's claims and the complete and utter lack of quantitative justification for those claims. We cannot emphasize this point strongly enough: although the decision about whether something possesses CSI appears to require at the very least a choice of probability space, a probability estimate, a discussion of relevant background knowledge, an independence calculation, a rejection function, and a rejection region, none of these have been provided for any of the items on this list.

Now, about the claimed counterexamples given by the "IDEA Center Staff"...

<i>"election control, TDI pg. 9-20"</i>

This is the Caputo case. Jeff and I spent a good deal of time working over this one, since Dembski did actually apply some math to it. In the end, though, the probability that Dembski arrives at is much larger than his "universal small probability". Dembski, we point out, failed to consider a number of apparently reasonable and relevant hypotheses of Caputo getting the results he did. Beyond that, the sequence Dembski used for his analysis was invented by Dembski, since the actual sequence from the case apparently wasn't readily available. This is what I class as a semi-fictional triviality. It does nothing to demonstrate that Dembski's EF/DI is a workable -- and working -- concept.

<i>"intellectual property protection, TDI pg. 20-22"</i>

This is fundamentally dishonest on the part of "IDEA Center Staff". Dembski is not discussing the application of his EF/DI. but rather going over how 'agent action' has been <b>previously</b> detected in intellectual property cases. Dembski claims that the critical part of what they did before has been incorporated into his EF/DI, not that his EF/DI was used in the instances discussed.

<i>"forensic science, TDI pg. 22-24"</i>

Again, another "bait-and-switch" from the "IDEA Center Staff". Dembski does not show that <b>his</b> apparatus has been applied to anything in forensic science; he just asserts that forensic science needs design inferences. For a definitive response to Dembski's claims in this regard, see Dr. Gary Hurd's chapter in <i>Why Intelligent Design Fails</i>.

<i>"data falsification in science, TDI pg. 24-26; cryptography, pg. 26. . .) and non-human phenomena (SETI, TDI pg. 26-32; general randomness, pg 32-35"</i>

More "bait-and-switch" from the "IDEA Center Staff". The only thing in TDI prior to p. 36 that has any relevance to my claim is the Caputo case, and that's already been covered. These other things are discussion by Dembski of how "design inferences" are already part of scientific investigation, and have nothing whatever to do with demonstration that Demsbki's particular "design detection apparatus" is workable.

<i>"simple lifeforms, TDI pg. 55-62"</i>

Dembski does not attempt to apply his EF/DI here. He simply runs through which parts of the EF/DI antievolutionists accept as opposed to what he surmises certain evolutionists would object to. Dembski does not attempt to develop a specification in the form he gives in either chapter 5 of TDI or in chapter 2 of NFL. Dembski does not collect the set of all relevant "chance" hypotheses and demonstrate that for all of them, their probability is smaller than his "universal small probability". This section is just talk, not even an attempted application of the EF/DI.

<i>"the bacterial flagellum, NFL pg 279-302"</i>

Ah, here we come to the "example" that causes so much difficulty for ID cheerleaders. It seems that no matter how directly one shows that the "example" doesn't conform to the full GCEA of Dembski's EF/DI, they just can't accept that there is a problem. This is precisely the sole "example" that Casey Luskin proposed as rescuing ID design detection from the ranks of completely failed ideas. And what a creaky, hole-ridden example it is.

Let's see how "IDEA Center Staff" try to defend it...

<quote>
In Dembski's book, No Free Lunch, in Chapter 5, Dembski calculates the level of CSI in the flagellum (Chapter 5). Dembski discusses at length the definition of irreducible complexity how the combination of chance and law, (via the Darwinian mechanism) could not assemble it (pages 279-288) and then Dembski does a calculation of the level of complex and specified information in the flagellum. Dembski specifically tests the flagellum with regards to the Darwinian mechanism, contrary to Wesley's claims. Thus, Dembski writes: 

<i>"But how simple can a flagellum be and still attain this minimal level of function? It will need a bidirectional motor. Moreover, because it spins so fast, the motor will need to be attached to the cell wall and stabilized with stators, rings, and bushings. It will also need a propeller unit outside the cell wall. What's more, the entire flagellum needs to be self-assembling. Thus it will require various additional proteins that facilitate and regulate its construction even though these proteins do not appear in the actual flagellum. Now while it is true that various known flagella differ in complexity, the differences are in no way drastic. Moreover, a theoretical analysis of the sort just sketched, where one considers what is required for a flagellum to achieve a certain minimal level of function, indicates that the complexity of known flagella is not very different from the minimal complexity that such systems might in principle require. It follows that the bacterial flagellum thus constitutes an irreducibly complex system that is unattainable by the Darwinian mechanism."</i> (No Free Lunch, page 288) 

This quote sure makes it look like Dembski at least attempted to rule out the Darwinian hypothesis for explaining the origin of the flagellum. It is difficult to see how this passage could be read any other way. It appears that Wesley is incorrect to claim on his blog that Dembski didn't test the Darwinian mechanism with respect to the origin of the flagellum in chapter 5 of NFL.

No, I am quite correct in my criticism. Dembski is <i>handwaving</i> in the above. He simply <b>asserts</b> that the E. coli flagellum is "irreducibly complex" and therefore he need not include any evolutionary hypotheses in his calculations. Dembski does not consider any evolutionary hypothesis <i>within his EF/DI!</i> This is a classical logical fallacy, that of assuming what you set out to prove. <a href="http://www.counterbalance.net/perspevo/welsberry-frame.html">As I pointed out to Dembski in 2001</a>, his EF/DI is simply a conduit for one's pre-existing biases, and his E. coli flagellum example shows I was right to call it that way. The sole "hypothesis" of flagellar assembly that Dembski does consider is one that no sane biologist has ever proposed, and thus has no <b>relevance</b> to the notion of the origin of the E. coli flagellum. (I don't know of any insane ones proposing so, either, but I disclaim responsibility for tracking what they might say.) Thus, Dembski's set of <b>relevant</b> hypotheses in this exercise is actually the null set. (Second note: This also puts paid to the notion that the stated reason for Dembski to do this exercise has any value. You can't demonstrate that IC is a special case of SC by using IC in one's supposed calculation to show something is SC. You can't demonstrate that some conceptual property is a subset of another one by examining one instance in any case, but leaving that aside there's still plenty of fancy but fallacious footwork by Dembski in here.)

More defense by the "IDEA Center Staff":

<quote>
Also, in contrast to Wesley's first point, it appears that Dembski does exactly what Wesley claims Dembski didn't do: provide a specification for the flagellum: 

<i>"Determining whether an irreducibly complex system exhibits specified complexity involves two things: showing that the system is specified and calculating its probability (recall that probability and complexity are correlative notions--see section 1.3). Specification is never a problem. The irreducibly complex systems we consider, particularly those in biology, always satisfy independently given functional requirements (see section 3.7). For instance, in the case of the bacterial flagellum, humans developed outboard rotary motors well before they figured out that the flagellum was such a machien. This is not to say that for the biological function of a system to constitute a specification humans must have independently invented a system that performs the same function. Nevertheless, independent invention makes the detachability of a pattern from an event or object all the more stark (see section 2.5). At any rate, no biologist I know questions whether functional systems that arise in biology are specified. At issue always is whether the Darwinian mechanism, by enlisting natural selection, can overcome the vast probabilities that at first blish seem to arise with such systems and therewith break a vast improbabilitiy into a sequence of more meaningful probabilities."</i> (Dembski, No Free Lunch, pg. 289-290) 

After discussing the specification of the flagellum, Dembski goes on to calculate the probability of its evolution. In one reference I didn't mention on the air is that Dembski has explained what he means by specification with respect to biology: biologically advantageous functionality: 

<i>Is life specified? If so, to what patterns does life correspond, and how are these patterns given independently of life's origin? Obviously, pattern-forming rational agents like ourselves don't enter the scene till after life originates. Nonetheless, there are functional patterns to which life corresponds, and which are given independently of the actual living systems. An organism is a functional system comprising many functional subsystems. The functionality of organisms can be cashed out in any number of ways. Arno Wouters (1995) cashes it out globally in terms of viability of whole organisms. Michael Behe (1996) cashes it out in terms of the irreducible complexity and minimal function of biochemical systems. Even the staunch Darwinist Richard Dawkins will admit that life is specified functionally, cashing out the functionality of organisms in terms of reproduction of genes. Thus Dawkins (1987, p. 9) will write: "Complicated things have some quality, specifiable in advance, that is highly unlikely to have been acquired by random chance alone. In the case of living things, the quality that is specified in advance is . . . the ability to propagate genes in reproduction."</i>(Willam Dembski, Intelligent Design as a Theory of Information). 

In any case, it appears that with respect to Wesley's claim that Dembski 1) "failed to give a specification for the flagellum." and 2) "failed to eliminate any evolutionary hypothesis of origin for the E. coli flagellum" (in that supposedly "The single hypothesis Dembski considered was one of random assembly, a thoroughly non-evolutionary proposition" quotations from Dembski's book show that Dembski in fact did the exact things Wesley claims Dembski didn't do.

It is interesting that the "IDEA Center Staff" does not take up my objections concerning Dembski's E. coli "calculation" and rebut those. They simply quote Dembski's original text and assert victory, as if there were no possible critique. But I have not been reticent in giving my reasons for considering Dembski's "example" to be a failed one.

Dembski does not proceed via the stated methods of the GCEA. I am quite correct to point out the incontrovertible fact that Dembski did not provide a specification that met his own standard given in chapter 2 of NFL. I've already addressed the lack of consideration of relevant hypotheses in Dembski's "analysis".

On page 72 of No Free Lunch, Dembski summarizes the steps in his "argument schema". Step 3 is of special concern to us, since it tells us what a "specification" looks like: it is a "rejection function f" and a "rejection region R". R is itself specified in terms of real numbers. Now, compare Dembski's proffered specification for the E. coli flagellum: methinks it is like an outboard motor. No rejection function and accompanying rejection region is given. Dembski comes nowhere close to fulfilling his own criteria on this. It gets worse as one considers that no steps are taken toward fulfilling the criteria of #4 on page 72, either.

Jeff Shallit and I already covered Dembski's loose approach to specification in detail in our paper.

<quote>

We also believe Dembski's current notion of specification is too vague to be useful. More precisely, Dembski's notion is su±ciently vague that with hand-waving he can apply it to the cases he is really interested in with little or no formal verification.

According to its formal definition, a specification is supposed to be a rejection region <eqn>R</eqn> of the form <eqn>\{\omega \in \Omega : f(\omega) \geq \gamma\}</eqn> or <eqn>\{\omega \in \Omega : f(\omega) \leq \delta\}</eqn> for an appropriate choice of a rejection function f and real numbers <eqn>\gamma, \delta</eqn>. Now consider Dembski's discussion of the "specification" of the flagellum of Escherichia coli : "...in the case of the bacterial flagellum, humans developed outboard rotary motors well before they figured out that the flagellum was such a machine."

We have no objection to natural language specifications per se, provided there is some evident way to translate them to Dembski's formal framework. But what, precisely, is the space of events ­ here? And what is the precise choice of the rejection function f and the rejection region R? Dembski does not supply them. Instead he says, "At any rate, no biologist I know questions whether the functional systems that arise in biology are specified." That may be, but the question is not, "Are such systems specified?", but rather, "Are the systems specified in the precise technical sense that Dembski requires?" Since Dembski himself has not produced such a specification, it is premature to answer affirmatively.

No, this is not "a matter of debate". Either Dembski's apparatus can be shown to actually <i>work</i>, or it is as yet a barren bit of philosophical folderol. So far, the ID cheerleaders have been unable to provide any examples of Dembski's EF/DI being fully (as in showing every step in the GCEA with all the math filled in) and successfully (as in demonstrating that all the math was done correctly and that the resulting probability falls below the "universal small probability" or some justified "local small probability") applied to any phenomenon whatsoever. Just like I said on the radio show.

As for Dembski's performance in <i>The Design Revolution</i>, let's say the ID cheerleaders vastly overrate it and leave it at that.

<i>"Dembski's ideas can be applied in science--we can calculate the level of CSI in a biological structure, just as Dembski does for the flagellum in ch. 5 of No Free Lunch."</i>

Really? Then please do so, and publish the fully worked-out calculation. This is not a new complaint of mine. <a href="http://www.counterbalance.net/perspevo/wdweqa-lg.ram">I suggested to Dembski that a workbook of examples of his EF/DI applied to a number of biological events would be useful in 2001.</a> But neither the workbook nor any single example has yet come to pass. Dembski failed to do so for the flagellum, cheerleading aside, and I predict that the "IDEA Center Staff" will do no better. Until such time, I have no qualms in stating to the world the simple observation that so far "intelligent design" design detection methods are sucking the big goose egg for successful application to anything, anywhere.

If Dembski's "design detection" methodology was actually being routinely applied to do useful work, as Calvert claimed on the PowerPoint radio show, one would like to think that the ID cheerleaders would be able to point to more than one heavily criticized, very much disputed example as support for their claim.
