<big><i>Phippidus princeps</i> -- <a href="http://www.cirrusimage.com/spider_Phidippus_princeps.htm">jumping spider</a> -- munching on <i>Eupeodes</i> sp. -- <a href="http://bugguide.net/node/view/11609/bgimage">hoverfly</a>.</big> Mr. Deneslbeck ("Just Al" to PT readers) is a naturalist and semi-professional photographer. He writes, "Nothing endangered, remarkable, or of particular scientific interest to either of these, I just liked the photo.  I haven't defined why jumping spiders seem to have more personality than other species of arachnid, including those with two distinct eyes in the front, but I don't think I'm alone."  He runs a website <a href="http://wading-in.net/">here</a> and recently posted a favorable review of my very favorite book <a href="http://wading-in.net/walkabout/2010/11/book-review-why-evolution-works-and-creationism-fails/">here</a>.
