<strike>Also, I have just heard that Kenneth Miller will be interviewed on <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3032633/">NBC's Today Show</a> on Monday morning, opposed by Steve Fuller.  Note to Today Show staff: make sure you give Fuller <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/dover/day15am.html#day15am318">decaf</a>.</strike> <strong>Update:</strong> this segment of the Today Show has been canceled at the last minute.  So, never mind.
