<img align="left" src="http://home.earthlink.net/~tjneal/Darwin_in_a_Vise.jpg"/>If anyone needed any more evidence that the scientists' boycott of the <a href="http://redstaterabble.blogspot.com/">Kansas Kangaroo Court</a> was an excellent idea, and that the Kangaroo Court didn't go at all well for Intelligent Design Creationists
 (most of the ID proponents were proved to be straight-up creationists at the hearings) -- well, <a href="http://www.uncommondescent.com/index.php/archives/59">here it is</a>.

William Dembski, in a post entitled "<a href="http://www.uncommondescent.com/index.php/archives/59">The Vise Strategy: Squeezing the Truth out of Darwinists</a>," <a href="http://www.uncommondescent.com/index.php/archives/59">is now fantasizing</a> about "the day when the hearings are not voluntary but involve subpoenas that compel evolutionists to be deposed and interrogated at length on their views."  

As a bonus feature, the post features photos of a stuffed Darwin toy with his head being squished in a vise (see photo, above left). (Let me be the first to pass on the indignant cry of <a href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/pt-archives/000913.html">Professor Steve Steve</a> and condemn this flagrant abuse of plush toy rights.)

On the last PT thread where Dembski's show-trial fantasies were being explored (see "<a href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/pt-archives/001016.html">'Waterloo' delayed? Again?</a>"), a commenter made <a href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/pt-archives/001016.html#c28933">a particularly perceptive point</a> which I should pass on: <b>Rule #34</b> of the <b><a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/crackpot.html">Baez Crackpot Index</a></b> states: <quote><b>34.</b> 40 points for claiming that when your theory is finally appreciated, present-day science will be seen for the sham it truly is. (30 more points for fantasizing about show trials in which scientists who mocked your theories will be forced to recant.).<ref><a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/crackpot.html">Baez Crackpot Index</a>, #34</ref></quote>

One last thought.  Dembski concludes his call for compulsory inquisitions of scientists by writing, <quote><b>"There are ways for this to happen, and the wheels are in motion (e.g., Congressional hearings over the teaching of biology in federally funded high schools for military kids)."</b><ref>William Dembski, "<a href="http://www.uncommondescent.com/index.php/archives/59">The Vise Strategy: Squeezing the Truth out of Darwinists</a></ref></quote>

Does anyone else find it ironic that Dembski complains about the <i><a href="http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/scopes/SCO_INHE.HTM">Inherit the Wind</a></i> stereotype of the Scopes Trial, in a post that calls for evolutionists to be dragged before McCarthyist Congressional hearings?

[That loud <i>whoomp</i> sound you just heard was the sudden collapse of the <a href="http://tinyurl.com/b7syp">irony meter</a> grid for North America.  The self-referential nature of the preceding irony created a positive feedback loop that swept across the grid at the speed of light, knocking out every irony meter in its path in a geometrically-growing catastrophic irony cascade.  The denizens of <i>The Panda's Thumb</i> would like to apologize in advance for any damage caused as a result of this accidental interaction between ID and reality.]
