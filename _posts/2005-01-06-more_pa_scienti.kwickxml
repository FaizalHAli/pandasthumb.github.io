According to this blog post by <a href="http://www.phil.upenn.edu/~weisberg/papers.html">Michael Weisberg</a>, "<a href="http://webapp.utexas.edu/blogs/archives/sarkarlab/002895.html">Penn Faculty Responds to Dover School Board</a>," about 30 members of the <a href="http://www.bio.upenn.edu/">Biology</a> and <a href="http://www.phil.upenn.edu/">Philosophy</a> Departments at the <a href="http://www.upenn.edu/">University of Pennsylvania</a> (an <a href="http://www.intothebest.com/ivy-league/ivy-league-schools.jsp">Official Ivy League School</a>, it is worth mentioning) have signed on to an open letter opposing the "intelligent design" policy of the Dover Area School Board.  

This follows a <a href="http://ydr.com/story/letters/51884/">similar letter</a> last month by the Biology Department of York College (see the PT post <a href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/pt-archives/000655.html">Doverian doings</a> and the news story "<a href="http://ydr.com/story/doverbiology/51833/">College biologists blast Dover</a>").
