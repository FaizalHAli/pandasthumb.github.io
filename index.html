<p>Our colleague Joshua Swamidass <a href="https://peacefulscience.org/dover-behe/">reports</a> on the blog Peaceful Science that he was interviewed yesterday along with Michael Behe. I have not yet had a chance to watch the interview, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltmhpG8fydM">Michael Behe: Kafka at the Dover trial</a> (actually, I am hoping for a transcript), so I will merely note that Dr. Behe apparently compared the Dover trial to the book <em>The Trial</em> by Franz Kafka. I have read <em>The Trial</em> and also much of the transcript of the Dover trial, and I find that claim astonishing though, as I said, I have not actually seen the interview yet.</p>

<p>At any rate, here is part of what Dr. Swamidass has to say:</p>

<p>In his video, which we have discussed <em>ad nauseam</em> in <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2020/09/are-evolutionary-biologists-ignoring-science.html">our
extremely long recent thread</a> Mark Champneys claims that
scientists are ignoring science when they claim that natural selection can
result in functional information increasing in the genome.  In the subsequent
discussion, Champneys insisted that there was a generalized form of the Second
Law which made such increase impossible, insisted that it applied not just to
isolated systems but to non-isolated populations of organisms, and that it
did prevent natural selection from achieving long-term improvement.</p>
<p>
In this post, I hope to show a very simple example, and to get away from
the issue of whether this has anything to do with the Second Law.  If we
can focus on discussing whether the approach of a stochastic process to its
equilibrium prevents natural selection from having effect, maybe we
can avoid having 1,600-plus comments and actually discuss the matter at hand.
<p>
Let's try for that focus and relevance.  Surely someone who wants scientists
to actually grapple with the science must agree with that goal.  Right?  Let's
see ...

        <p><a href="https://evolutionnews.org/2020/10/does-gold-have-a-purpose-science-hints-at-answers/">Does gold have a purpose?</a> asks an unnamed author in <em>Evolution News &amp; Science Today</em>. The author goes on to observe that there is more gold on earth than astrophysicists can account for and also that gold has risen to the surface of the earth faster than might be expected. They go on to note the “availability of many essential elements at the surface of the earth …” and also discuss the use of gold in medicine. They are somewhat breathless at the discovery that the body can metabolize gold:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Gold nanoparticles, which are <strong>supposed to be stable</strong> in biological environments, <strong>can be degraded inside cells</strong>, [boldface in original]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>even though, as they note, gold salts have been used for decades in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.</p>

<p>At any rate, the article stresses the “mystery of biological gold” and claims several hints why gold may have a purpose: its abundance and seemingly unlikely transport to the surface of the earth, the ability of cells to “metabolize” [sic] gold, the fact that gold persists in the body, and the usefulness of gold for therapeutics. The conclusion of the article is</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since ID advocates are better equipped to think outside the box than are the paradigm-locked materialist scientists, they are more free to consider a positive answer — showing once again that intelligent design is not a “science stopper” but a fruitful way to pursue interesting questions. If the answer is “Yes, gold has a purpose,” the applications could be profound.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Au boy! The author seems a little Au-struck by what seem to me relatively unrelated scientific discoveries and is trying Au-fully hard to weave them together into a fine-tuning argument. Here is my translation of the conclusion:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since intelligent-design creationists are desperately searching for “hints” of design, they are more likely than empirically based scientists to come up with a positive answer — showing once again that intelligent-design creationists can pretend that any unanticipated scientific discovery leads to “interesting questions.” If the answer is, “Yes, gold has a purpose,” no practical applications will result.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually, the answer to the question is, “Yes, gold, like anything else, has whatever purposes we assign to it.”</p>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roseate_spoonbill">Platalea ajaja L.</a>, roseate spoonbill, with young. The photographer writes, "This shot was taken at the Alligator Farm in St. Augustine, Florida.  This is a popular place (among the birds, as well as humans) because, while nestlings that fall to the surface are lost, the nests are safe from such predators as raccoons, bobcats, and snakes due to the inaccessibility of the trees’ bases.  The color is due, as in flamingos, to carotenoids in the diet.  According to Wikipedia, the roseate’s closest relative is the yellow-billed spoonbill, which is found in southeast Australia.  They do get around."</figcaption>
