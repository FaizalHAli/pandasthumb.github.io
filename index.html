<p>
 In a famous scene in <em>Monty Python and the Holy Grail</em>, King Arthur and his knights encounter the menacing figures of The Knights Who Say "Ni" (pronounced "nee").  The word
 is so unhearable that Arthur and his men fall back in anguish, covering their ears.  Ultimately, they are allowed to pass, but only after providing those Knights with what they want, "a shrubbery".
  <p>
    If you thought that the scene was farfetched, think again.  At <em>Evolution News and and Science Today</em> their anonymous commentator (Casey Luskin? David Klinghoffer?), in an article about the giraffe genome, <a href="https://evolutionnews.org/2021/05/giraffe-genome-is-not-evolutionary/"><strong>complains about an equally unhearable word</strong></a>.  After interpreting the evolution of the giraffe as brought about by Design rather than by evolutionary processes, the real complaint comes out:

<p>A high-school English teacher once told our class that “higher education is a process of learning more and more about less and less.” Catchy and memorable, but only true to the extent that most of our careers—academic and otherwise—tend to make us “experts” on a limited number of topics. So it is inevitable that we will confront some information that is outside our expertise, and we will need to make judgments about arguments, actions, or policies based on this information.</p>

<p>Recently, journalist Nicholas Wade authored a <a href="https://thebulletin.org/2021/05/the-origin-of-covid-did-people-or-nature-open-pandoras-box-at-wuhan/"> piece in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists</a> about the origin of SARS-CoV-2—the coronavirus that is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic—giving credence to the claim that the virus was leaked from a laboratory in Wuhan (China) instead of emerging from a natural reservoir such as local bat populations.</p>

<p>Those who have expertise in the details of laboratory research with viruses can certainly evaluate and critique the claims that Wade presented in support of his argument. But what about the rest of us? How do we evaluate arguments with important consequences without resorting to “dueling experts” who claim equal authority and come down on opposite sides?</p>

        <p>Dan Phelps, in a guest post on Pharyngula, observed the other day that <a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2021/05/08/answers-in-genesiss-statement-of-faith-becomes-more-strident/">Answers in Genesis’s Statement of Faith Becomes More Strident</a>, and indeed it has. Mr. Phelps has dredged up the old version of the statement of faith from the Wayback Machine and compared it with the new. You may read Mr. Phelps’s article for yourself, but in a nutshell, he notes that the new version argues that</p>

<p>Granville Sewell is at it again, and he never seems to learn.  In <a href="https://evolutionnews.org/2021/04/some-problems-can-be-proved-unsolvable/">a piece at the Discovery Institute’s site Evolution News &amp; Science Today</a> 
he argues that it is obvious that one can reject the ordinary processes of physics, chemistry, and evolution as having brought about living organisms. His piece is entitled “Some problems can be proved unsolvable”.
He mentions a mathematical theorem that was finally proven after hundreds of years (Fermat’s Last Theorem), and a task that can easily shown to be unsolvable
(covering with two-square-sized dominos a chessboard that has had two squares in opposite corners removed).  Then he argues that it is obvious that evolving present-day
life that ends up inventing iPhones can easily be seen to be impossible by natural processes.</p>
<p>
He summarizes his argument in a few sentences:

<blockquote>
Well, I have a very simple proof that the biological problem #3 posed above is also impossible to solve, that does fit in the margin of this document. All one needs 
to do is realize that if a solution were found, we would have proved something obviously false, that a few (four, apparently) fundamental, unintelligent 
forces of physics alone could have rearranged the fundamental particles of physics into libraries full of science texts and encyclopedias, 
computers connected to monitors, keyboards, laser printers and the Internet, cars, trucks, airplanes, nuclear power plants and Apple iPhones. 
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Is this really a valid proof? It seems perfectly valid to me, as I cannot think of anything in all of science that can be stated with more 
confidence than that a few unintelligent forces of physics alone could not have rearranged the basic particles of physics into Apple iPhones.
</blockquote>

Now Sewell is a mathematician, author of a book on solving differential equations.  But he seems to accept proof-by-obviousness, a method most mathematicians
would not accept.  He should listen to them.  Instead he lays the obviousness on a bit too thick ...
