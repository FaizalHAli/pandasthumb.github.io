<p>The Ark Encounter’s attendance for July, 2020, totals 57,632, according to a recent Kentucky Open Records Act (KORA) request. Of course this figure doesn’t include the hordes (eye roll) of children and lifetime members Ken Ham claims are pouring into the park and need not buy a ticket.</p>

<p>The latest figure is a bit more than a third of some previous years’ July attendance figures (see the graph, above). This low number is understandable considering the current coronavirus pandemic. These numbers do not suggest any massive increase in attendance due to the opening of their new <a href="https://arkencounter.com/virtual-reality/">virtual-reality</a> (virtual unreality?) theater adjacent to the Ark-shaped building. Apparently, in the new VR theater one can climb into a special “Truth Traveller” pod and don the latest high-tech VR glasses, then see Noah herding dinosaurs onto the Ark (ain’t “science“ and technology great?).  The VR show will cost $14.99 at present (supposedly this is an introductory offer; the price is going up soon) on top of the $49.95 adult ticket to see Mr. Ham’s fantasy. I suspect the VR glasses will be a nightmare to clean between showings.</p>

<p>It is hard to say whether they are hurting due to the coronavirus pandemic; Ken Ham’s fundraiser last spring to “reopen the Ark” netted well over $1.1 million. Moreover, Crosswater Canyon, the non-profit owned by the Answers in Genesis ministry, received between $1 million and 2 million in Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) money. Their gate receipts for 2018 and 2019, however, must have been in the $30-40 million range, and they will not achieve those receipts again for some time.</p>

        <p>We have all become amateur epidemiologists, and I frankly thought there would be hell to pay when the Covid epidemic finally reached Africa. According to a <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/369/6505/756">news article</a> by journalist Linda Nordling of Cape Town South Africa, writing in <em>Science</em>, Africa</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>seems to have weathered the pandemic relatively well so far, with fewer than one confirmed case for every thousand people and just 23,000 deaths. Yet several antibody surveys suggest far more Africans have been infected with the coronavirus—a discrepancy that is puzzling scientists around the continent.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/369/6504/624">more technical article</a> by Moustapha Mbow and colleagues, much of which I thought I understood, led to a similar conclusion. Several explanations have been proposed, including the simple fact that Africans are on the whole younger than, say, Europeans and Americans. The explanation may also be genetic. Another hypothesis, however, is that Africans are infected with various parasites, which ramp up their immune systems so that they can effectively fight new pathogens. Mbow and colleagues cite the “hygiene hypothesis” and suggest that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>early and chronic exposure to pathogens leading to relentless immune cell activation in harsh environments induces a strong regulatory immune response to counteract excessive inflammation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Before I give succor to any anti-vaxxers, let me state that this hypothesis in no way militates against vaccinating for measles, mumps, chickenpox, pertussis (or whooping cough), polio, or all the other deadly childhood diseases that were commonplace when I was in grade school and do not appear every hundred years or so.</p>

<p>A day or so after my physician advised me to get a flu shot, I ran across two articles, one by reporter Kelly Servick <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/08/how-will-covid-19-affect-coming-flu-season-scientists-struggle-clues">in Science</a> and another by reporters Lesley Wroughton and Max Bearak <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/south-africa-coronavirus-flu-season/2020/08/17/bd8aaaca-e084-11ea-82d8-5e55d47e90ca_story.html">in the Washington Post</a>. These articles noted that there has been almost no flu season in South Africa this year, and the Post quoted Cheryl Cohen of South Africa’s Institute for Communicable Diseases to the effect that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The main explanation is that measures against coronavirus are having an impact on flu transmission.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That explanation, if it holds up, will be good news to those who are concerned about a flu epidemic piggybacked on top of the current Sars epidemic. It would be better news if the United States were taking stronger measures against the coronavirus, but God forbid I should make a political statement like that.</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce that the 12th annual Panda’s Thumb photography contest has reopened. Owing to the long delay, we have elected to extend the entry period by approximately one week, until Monday, August 24, at 12:00 noon, Mountain Daylight Saving Time. You may find the rules <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2020/06/photography-contest-xii.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>Those who have already entered the contest have been extremely patient. We have therefore decided, consistently with the last-stated rule, to allow them each one extra entry.</p>

<p>As in previous years, we plan to choose a handful of finalists and ask our readers to vote for their favorites. We will post a poll on or before August 31 and display the winner on September 7.</p>

<p>I’m sad to announce that Glenn Morton, the geophysicist and former creation scientist who eventually became a critic of creationism, and who coined the term “Morton’s Demon”, died on August 5 after a long battle with cancer. He was 70.</p>

        <p>Ed Brayton was an amazing man and one of the founders of Pandasthumb. I’m saddened to report that after a long battle with his health, he died last night. It happened a few days after <a href="https://www.patheos.com/blogs/dispatches/2020/08/10/saying-goodbye-for-the-last-time/">he decided to enter hospice care</a>. He died on his own terms and as peacefully as possible.</p>

<p>We are all grateful to have known him and been influenced by him. His voice will be missed.</p>
