        <p>Today Nathan H. Lents authored an article in the <em>Skeptical Inquirer</em>, telling the story of how we responded to Michael Behe’s last book. Specifically, in February of 2019, Michael Behe published the third book in his trilogy critiquing evolutionary science, <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/363/6427/590"><em>Darwin Devolves</em></a>.</p>

<p>In this book, Dr. Behe argues that adaptive evolution proceeds almost entirely by degrading or damaging genes. Even when evolution increases the fitness of organisms, it does so by destroying information in the genome, so evolution is a self-limited process that cannot explain the diversity of life.</p>

<p>The month before his book was published, in January of 2019, Richard Lenski, Nathan Lents, and I published <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/363/6427/590">an 800-word review that was critical of <em>Darwin Devolves</em></a> together in <em>Science</em>.</p>

<p>We expected a reaction from the Discovery Institute (DI).</p>

<p>This is very old news, but I just learned of the resolution of the lawsuit Grant County Board of Education v. Ark Encounter. Unsurprisingly, the Grant County News (a very pro-Ark newspaper) did not cover the outcome of this case, although the paper had covered the initial lawsuit. The Louisville Courier-Journal also did a <a href="https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/northeast/2019/08/27/ark-encounter-kentucky-pva-sued-for-undervalued-property/2128604001/">story on the initial lawsuit</a> on August 27, 2019. I discussed the situation with many people back in 2019, but was unaware of the final result until now, since it was unreported outside legal databases. The final decision (summarized briefly below) was not given until July 29, 2020, and was not widely reported.</p>

<p>Since the school board lost the lawsuit in 2020, the following is moot, but shows yet another way the Ark has shortchanged the locals.</p>

<p>A team from the University of New South Wales in Australia has discovered a very ancient and well-preserved log that they used to <a href="https://phys.org/news/2021-02-ancient-relic-earth-history-years.html">date the last reversal of the earth’s magnetic field very precisely to 42 ka (thousand years) ago</a>. Using climate modelling and whatnot, they calculated a detailed timescale and deduced that the magnetic-field reversal – known as the Laschamps Excursion – coincided with high solar activity and may have caused glaciation in North America and a relatively sudden change in the climate in Australia, which may in turn have led to the extinction of the Neanderthals and some early modern human cultures, and of megafaunas in Australia.</p>

<p>Because the field reversal occurred 42 millennia ago, the team dubbed it the Adams Event, in honor of Douglas Adams, who wrote in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy">Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy</a> that the answer to life, the universe, and everything is 42.</p>

<p><em>Posts labeled “Report:” will discuss material posted on other sites, particularly ones that contain silly arguments</em></p>

<p>An interesting report in this paper:<br />
Gemmell, Brad J., Kevin T. Du Clos, Sean P. Colin, Kelly R. Sutherland and John H. Costello.  2021. The most efficient metazoan swimmer creates a ‘virtual wall’ to enhance performance.  Proceedings of the Royal Society B (Biological Sciences)<br />
<a href="http://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2020.2494">http://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2020.2494</a><br />
argues that jellyfish use a subtle fluid dynamic effect, the ‘ground effect’, to swim efficiently.  The suthors used sophisticated monitoring techniques to measure the movement of water, as well as computationally intensive calculation methods of fluid dynamics.  They found that when the body of the common Moon Jelly <em>Aurelia aurita</em> contracts, it creates two vortices, each like a smoke ring, but rotating in opposite directions.  Together they function as a ‘virtual wall’ against which water is pushed.  The result is extraordinarily efficient swimming.  The paper is open access and may be read at the link above.</p>

<p>The ground effect has been known in fluid dynamics since the 1920s, when pilots reported that their planes flew more efficiently when close to the ground, an effect due to the air beneath the wings being compressed by being squeezed between the wings and the ground.  A number of countries have tested vehicles used the ground effect to “fly” just above the surface of the ocean.  The most active development program was the models of “ekranoplans” produced in Soviet-era Russia in the 1970s and 1980s, one of which you will see above.  The model shown there was also capable of a limited amount of actual flight.</p>

<p>But as astonishing as jellyfish are, and as surprising as ground-effect vehicles are,
they have inspired an actual flight of fancy.  This was by the ever-astonishing
Denyse O’Leary, who writes for the ID advocacy blog Uncommon Descent.  Her
argument needs to be quoted – you would not believe me if I summarized it …</p>

  <figcaption>Mr. Rintoul writes, "Darwin's Window is the local name for a sea arch in an ancient cinder/ash cone known as Cerro Brujo (Hill of the Sorcerer), on the northwest-facing side of San Cristobal in the Galapagos Archipelago. The view through this arch includes three common noddies (<i>Anous stolidus</i>, aka brown noddy) as well as a formation known as Kicker Rock. Darwin landed on San Cristobal during his time in the Galapagos, and this formation (along with Darwin's Bay, where he allegedly landed) is named in his honor.
