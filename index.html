        <p>Last month I argued  that <a href="https://www.snopes.com/news/2021/02/04/why-creationism-bears-all-the-hallmarks-of-a-conspiracy-theory/">present-day creationism is a conspiracy theory</a>, that like other conspiracy theories, it has its own rules of evidence, and that one underlying driver for this conspiracy theory is a struggle for power. Two recent developments give substance to my claim.</p>

<p>Firstly, regarding the rules of evidence. We are familiar with the creationist claim that ancient-earth geology and the related studies such as the fossil record are mere historical sciences, based on unproven and unprovable assumptions about unrepeatable past events, whereas the scientific method requires reproducibility.</p>

<p>The errors here are obvious. The observations must, circumstances permitting, be reproducible, but the past event inferred need not be. For example, recent DNA evidence established that the father of the Archbishop of Canterbury was not the person named on his birth certificate. We can test this conclusion, to the highest scientific standards, by repeating the DNA test, but there is no need to beget additional Archbishops to prove our point. We do indeed assume, with Hutton, that the present is the key to the past, but this assumption is itself the result of repeated observation. We can see rain splashes in billion-year-old mudstone and rounded pebbles in ancient riverbeds. The resemblance between past and present is not, as creationists claim, an input into interpretation but an outcome of observation.</p>

        <p>Should sectarian religious colleges that teach creationism be accredited? Our colleague, Joshua Swamidass, writing in the Wall Street Journal, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-compromise-on-creationism-11614901537">answers with a qualified yes</a>. Specifically, the issue involves an accrediting agency known as Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools, or Tracs. Tracs was established in the 1970â€™s to provide accreditation for colleges and universities that taught young-earth creationism and six literal days of creation, rather than modern science. Eventually, Tracs was recognized by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation, or CHEA, which is in essence an umbrella agency that accredits accrediting agencies. The recognition of Tracs by CHEA is up for renewal this year.</p>

<p>But should Tracs colleges be accredited? Should Tracs be recognized? Dr. Swamidass thinks so but would require stringent conditions. To oversimplify his position, he thinks that colleges should be allowed to teach creationism, but if Tracs is to accredit them, then they must agree to teach modern science as well. He writes,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As a matter of academic freedom, scientists should tolerate institutions that teach creation science. But deviations from national norms in a science curriculum need to be prominently disclosed, tracked and reported. In practice, that means transcripts that clearly state which courses and degrees include creation science. Credit from courses that include creation science should not be used toward science degrees. Nor should they be eligible for transfer to secular institutions.</p>
</blockquote>

</figure>

<p>The photographer was facing west, a short time, possibly as much as an hour, after sunrise. The mountain is illuminated by direct sunlight, but you can see the shadow of the mountain on which Dr. Dullien is perched. The top of the mountain looks reddish, in part because the rocks are red and probably in part because the sun is reddish early in the morning. In the shadow, the mountain is bluish because, well, because shadows are bluish because they are illuminated by scattered light.</p>

<p>But why is the sky pink? The photograph of the mountain is sharp, so there is no aerosol to the west. I was stumped. For an answer, I checked in with Stephen Corfidi of the NOAA/NWS Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma. I discovered Dr. Corfidi through his splendid post, <a href="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/publications/corfidi/sunset/">The Colors of Sunset and Twilight</a>.</p>

<p>Without going into detail, Dr. Corfidi thinks that the pink sky in the west is essentially a reflection of the red sky in the east, by the aerosols in the west. That is, the aerosols in the west are scattering (reflecting) some of the red light back eastward. The scattered light may be pink rather than red or red-orange if there are scatterers in the lower atmosphere, but that explanation gets a little messy. I am also going to guess that some blue sky resulting from direct sunlight peeks through and shifts the spectrum slightly to the blue, as well as possibly reducing the saturation of the back-scattered light.</p>

        <p>Today Nathan H. Lents authored an <a href="https://skepticalinquirer.org/2021/03/behe-bias-and-bears-oh-my/">article in the <em>Skeptical Inquirer</em></a>, telling the story of how we responded to Michael Beheâ€™s last book. Specifically, in February of 2019, Michael Behe published the third book in his trilogy critiquing evolutionary science, <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/363/6427/590"><em>Darwin Devolves</em></a>.</p>

<p>In this book, Dr. Behe argues that adaptive evolution proceeds almost entirely by degrading or damaging genes. Even when evolution increases the fitness of organisms, it does so by destroying information in the genome, so evolution is a self-limited process that cannot explain the diversity of life.</p>

<p>The month before his book was published, in January of 2019, Richard Lenski, Nathan Lents, and I published <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/363/6427/590">an 800-word review that was critical of <em>Darwin Devolves</em></a> together in <em>Science</em>.</p>

<p>We expected a reaction from the Discovery Institute (DI).</p>
