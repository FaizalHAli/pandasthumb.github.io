<p>This book is entitled <em>Understanding Evolution</em>, but it is perhaps as much about <em>the</em> understanding <em>of</em> evolution and why some people do not understand it or refuse to understand it. In this essay, I concentrate  on “the understanding of,” or what I might call the meta-evolution parts of the book.</p>

<p>This is the second edition of the book; <a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2014/04/now-book-on-und.html">John Wilkins reviewed the first on PT</a> in 2014. It is a short book, well under 200 pages and 8 chapters, counting the unnumbered Concluding Remarks. The book is generally easy to read, with one exception that I shall note below. The early chapters especially have a lot of useful figures, mostly well annotated and well captioned. Many of them suffer from being in black and white, and look like they were originally prepared in color but never seriously adapted to black and white. The book ends with a useful summary of common misconceptions about evolution.</p>

<p>Yesterday, March 14, was Pi Day, and I learned today that several representatives introduced a <a href="https://www.congress.gov/117/bills/hres221/BILLS-117hres221ih.pdf">RESOLUTION Expressing support for designation of March 14, 2021, as “National Pi Day”</a>. I thought it was a good resolution, and it concluded,</p>

<blockquote>Whereas Pi can be approximated as 3.14, and thus March 14, 2021, is an appropriate day for "National Pi Day": Now, therefore, be it <br /><br />

<i>Resolved</i>, That the House of Representatives— <br />

(1) supports the designation of a "Pi Day" and its celebration around the world; <br />

(2) recognizes the continuing importance of the National Science Foundation’s math and science education programs; <br />

and (3) encourages schools and educators to observe the day with appropriate activities that teach students about Pi and engage them about the study of mathematics.</blockquote>

<p>The bill was <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/221/all-info">introduced on March 11</a>, which gave them 3 days to pass it. Guess where the bill is now….</p>

        <p>Last month I argued  that <a href="https://www.snopes.com/news/2021/02/04/why-creationism-bears-all-the-hallmarks-of-a-conspiracy-theory/">present-day creationism is a conspiracy theory</a>, that like other conspiracy theories, it has its own rules of evidence, and that one underlying driver for this conspiracy theory is a struggle for power. Two recent developments give substance to my claim.</p>

<p>Firstly, regarding the rules of evidence. We are familiar with the creationist claim that ancient-earth geology and the related studies such as the fossil record are mere historical sciences, based on unproven and unprovable assumptions about unrepeatable past events, whereas the scientific method requires reproducibility.</p>

<p>The errors here are obvious. The observations must, circumstances permitting, be reproducible, but the past event inferred need not be. For example, recent DNA evidence established that the father of the Archbishop of Canterbury was not the person named on his birth certificate. We can test this conclusion, to the highest scientific standards, by repeating the DNA test, but there is no need to beget additional Archbishops to prove our point. We do indeed assume, with Hutton, that the present is the key to the past, but this assumption is itself the result of repeated observation. We can see rain splashes in billion-year-old mudstone and rounded pebbles in ancient riverbeds. The resemblance between past and present is not, as creationists claim, an input into interpretation but an outcome of observation.</p>

        <p>Should sectarian religious colleges that teach creationism be accredited? Our colleague, Joshua Swamidass, writing in the Wall Street Journal, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-compromise-on-creationism-11614901537">answers with a qualified yes</a>. Specifically, the issue involves an accrediting agency known as Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools, or Tracs. Tracs was established in the 1970’s to provide accreditation for colleges and universities that taught young-earth creationism and six literal days of creation, rather than modern science. Eventually, Tracs was recognized by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation, or CHEA, which is in essence an umbrella agency that accredits accrediting agencies. The recognition of Tracs by CHEA is up for renewal this year.</p>

<p>But should Tracs colleges be accredited? Should Tracs be recognized? Dr. Swamidass thinks so but would require stringent conditions. To oversimplify his position, he thinks that colleges should be allowed to teach creationism, but if Tracs is to accredit them, then they must agree to teach modern science as well. He writes,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As a matter of academic freedom, scientists should tolerate institutions that teach creation science. But deviations from national norms in a science curriculum need to be prominently disclosed, tracked and reported. In practice, that means transcripts that clearly state which courses and degrees include creation science. Credit from courses that include creation science should not be used toward science degrees. Nor should they be eligible for transfer to secular institutions.</p>
</blockquote>
