<p>An interesting report in this paper:
Gemmell, Brad J., Kevin T. Du Clos, Sean P. Colin, Kelly R. Sutherland and John H. Costello.  2021. The most efficient metazoan swimmer creates a ‘virtual wall’ to enhance performance.  Proceedings of the Royal Society B (Biological Sciences)<br />
<a href="http://doi.org/rspb.20202494">http://doi.org/rspb.20202494</a>
argues that jellyfish use a subtle fluid dynamic effect, the ‘ground effect’, to swim efficiently.  The suthors used sophisticated monitoring techniques to measure the movement of water, as well as computationally intensive calculation methods of fluid dynamics.  They found that when the body of the common Moon Jelly <em>Aurelia aurita</em> contracts, it creates two vortices, each like a smoke ring, but rotating in opposite directions.  Together they function as a ‘virtual wall’ against which the next contraction pushes water.  The result is extraordinarily efficient swimming.  The paper is open access and may be read at the link above.</p>

<p>The ground effect has been known in fluid dynamics since the 1920s, when pilots reported that their planes flew more efficiently when close to the ground, an effect due to the air beneath the wings being compressed by being squeezed between the wings and the ground.  A number of countries have tested vehicles used the ground effect to “fly” just above the surface of the ocean.  The most active development program was the models of “ekranoplans” produced in Soviet-era Russia in the 1970s and 1980s, one of which you will see above.  The model shown there was also capable of a limited amount of actual flight.</p>

<p>But as astonishing as jellyfish are, and as surprising as ground-effect vehicles are,
they have inspired an actual flight of fancy.  This was by the ever-astonishing
Denyse O’Leary, who writes for the ID advocacy blog Uncommon Descent.  Her
argument needs to be quoted – you would not believe me if I summarized it …</p>

  <figcaption>Mr. Rintoul writes, "Darwin's Window is the local name for a sea arch in an ancient cinder/ash cone known as Cerro Brujo (Hill of the Sorcerer), on the northwest-facing side of San Cristobal in the Galapagos Archipelago. The view through this arch includes three common noddies (<i>Anous stolidus</i>, aka brown noddy) as well as a formation known as Kicker Rock. Darwin landed on San Cristobal during his time in the Galapagos, and this formation (along with Darwin's Bay, where he allegedly landed) is named in his honor.

<p>The term “Wow! signal” represents a decade-long mystery in astronomy: In 1977, the astrophysicist Jerry Ehman received a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wow!_signal">strong narrowband radio signal</a> on the frequency of the 21 cm line of hydrogen with the gigantic big-ear radio telescope in Delaware in the US state of Ohio. There seemed to be no natural explanation for the persisting 72 s signal from the Sagittarius constellation, which was 30 standard deviations above the background noise. The profile of the strong, narrow-band signal corresponds to that of a communication antenna. Its discoverer highlighted the signal on the printout with a red circle and added an expression of astonishment by noting “Wow!” In the period that followed, there was a lively debate among experts as to whether it was an artificially generated or a natural signal. Although objects like pul-sars seem to be a possible source, the controversy continues to this day.</p>

<p>A few years ago, a team of Kazakh scientists published a <a href="www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0019103513000791">paper</a> claiming to have discovered a Wow! signal in the genetic code of living beings. The code structure, so they claimed, is statistically so striking that its origin could be explained only by the presumption of an intelligent actor. The paper, published in Icarus, was somewhat off-topic since Icarus is a journal for planetary science rather than molecular biology or evolution. Since then, the paper has been celebrated as evidence for the extraterrestrial origin of the genetic code by support-ers of ancient astronauts and by the intelligent design movement; see, for example, <a href="https://evolutionnews.org/2013/03/a_wow_signal_of/">here</a>, <a href="https://uncommondescent.com/intelligent-design/extraterrestrial-life-genetic-code-as-wow-signal/">here</a>, and <a href="https://www.discovery.org/id/peer-review/">here</a>, as well as <a href="http://www.si-journal.de/index2.php?artikel=jg22/heft2/sij222-2.html">this arti-cle</a> in a German creationist journal. What’s it all about?</p>

<p>Oh dear, we jumped on this message too fast. Mr. Phelps now tells us,</p>

  <p>It looks as if the site is a well-done fake. Please don’t promote it. The copyright people at the distribution company are on it.</p>

<p>You may still, however,</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Some of them obviously watched it, some plainly did not, and some read into it what they wanted to see. I resisted reviewing the film on Amazon until over the summer, when I saw a spate of 1-star reviews by people who had plainly not seen the film. In case anyone is interested, I will post my own 5-star Amazon review, posted on August 25, below the fold:</p>

<p>Is creationism a conspiracy theory? Our colleague <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Braterman">Paul Braterman</a> of the University of Glasgow thinks so: In an article, <a href="https://theconversation.com/why-creationism-bears-all-the-hallmarks-of-a-conspiracy-theory-153831">Why creationism bears all the hallmarks of a conspiracy theory</a>, he notes creationist</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>claims that the scientific establishment promoting evolution is an arrogant and morally corrupt elite.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>This so-called elite supposedly conspires to monopolise academic employment and research grants. Its alleged objective is to deny divine authority, and the ultimate beneficiary and prime mover is Satan.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Creationism,” he adds, “re-emerged in this form in reaction to the mid-20th century emphasis on science education.” “Creationists go to great lengths to demonise the proponents of evolution, and to undermine the overwhelming evidence in its favour.” Further, they “immunise themselves from fact-based criticism. They label the study of the past as based on unprovable assumptions, thus disqualifying in advance the plain evidence of geology.”</p>

<p>I can add only that creationists have to think that everyone else thinks as they do, in terms of vast conspiracies; otherwise, it would be hard to imagine 99 % of the world’s biologists engaged in a gigantic conspiracy. But if <em>everyone</em> is involved in a conspiracy, ….</p>
