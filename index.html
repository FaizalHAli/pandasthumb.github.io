<p>I think we have not been paying enough attention to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Meadows_(North_Carolina_politician)">Mark Meadows</a>, the White House Chief of Staff. We noted recently that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mr. Meadows may or may not be a creationist, but he is certainly a fellow traveler: At one time [2002], he purchased a piece of property on which an Allosaurus specimen had been discovered (supposedly by some home-schooled children). He then [2014] sold the property to Answers in Genesis, arguably in order to keep the fossils under the control of young-earth creationists.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That was a bit anodyne. In fact, according to an <a href="https://www.salon.com/2020/12/27/mark-meadows-has-skeletons-in-the-closet--dinosaur-skeletons-to-be-precise/">article In Salon</a>, it was Mr. Meadows’s daughter Haley who supposedly discovered the dinosaur on the last day of the dig. In fact, according to the Salon article, the fossil had been discovered two years earlier by the person, Dana Forbes, who had sold the property to Mr. Meadows. It was identified in 2001 by paleontologist Joe Taylor. That skeleton, as <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2014/05/dinosaur-fossil.html">we reported</a>, was eventually donated to the Creation “Museum” by</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the Elizabeth Streb Peroutka Foundation. The foundation’s leader Michael Peroutka until recently was also a board member of the League of the South, a white supremacist, neo-Confederate and pro-secessionist organization that has been named a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center[,]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>according to a press release from paleontologist Daniel Phelps.</p>

<p>According to the Salon article, besides involving his 9-year-old daughter in some kind of apparent fraud, Mr. Meadows</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>had since at least 2018 apparently failed to disclose a loan and monthly income of $11,000 related to the sale of a deed to a Colorado fossil park dedicated to promoting the creationist fiction that humans coexisted with dinosaurs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In addition, Salon reports that Mr. Meadows was sanctioned in 2018 for misusing taxpayer money and may have done so again in 2020. Finally, <a href="https://www.salon.com/2020/10/30/watchdog-files-complaint-accusing-trumps-chief-of-staff-mark-meadows-of-campaign-finance-crimes/">Salon reporting</a> has apparently inspired a watchdog group to file a complaint against Mr. Meadows with the Federal Election Commission.</p>

<p>
In argument with creationists one often hears the point made, triumphantly,
that natural selection is a tautology.  The implication is that evolutionary
biologists are so generally incompetent that they don't recognize this, and that
when they invoke the concept of fitness they are engaging in a meaningless
circular argument.  Natural selection, creationists argue, is supposed to be "survival
of the fittest".  Yet how do we define fittest?  Why, merely as those that
survive.  So it reduces to "survival of the survived", and thus cannot be
more than a meaningless incantation.  Gotcha!

        <p><em>Jerry Coyne <a href="https://whyevolutionistrue.com/2020/12/17/tonight-the-university-of-chicagos-world-famous-latke-hamentash-debate/">informs us</a> that the latke-versus-hamantash debate originated at the University of Chicago. He also reminds me that tonight is the last night of Chanukah, so I had better post this piece now. I wrote it years ago for the debate, Are Latkes Better Than Hamantashen? at my local synagogue. For those not in the know, latkes are a Chanukah delicacy: potato pancakes cooked in oil to represent the oil lamp that miraculously burned for eight days after the Maccabees rededicated the Temple. Hamantashen are triangular cookies eaten on the holiday of Purim (which is based on the Book of Esther).</em> Penimah <em>is a play on the Hebrew name</em> Peninah.</p>

<p>First, hamantashen are not kosher. (1) They have 3 sides, which symbolizes the Trinity.  (2) As if to drive the point home, they are filled with poppy seeds; these were originally popey seeds, from the Latin word <em>papaver</em>, which means true pope. (3) Finally, the word is really a corruption of Haman-<em>toosh</em>, and everyone knows that the hindquarters of an animal are not kosher.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the word for hamantashen in Hebrew is <em>oznay haman</em>, which means <em>Haman’s ears</em>. This means they give your children selective hearing and inspire them to poke holes in their earlobes (and maybe elsewhere).</p>

<p>Latkes are called <em>latkes</em> in Yiddish because they were developed by Lot, unlike Haman a righteous man and a nephew of my ancestor Abraham. The Hebrew word is <em>levivah</em>, which comes from the word <em>lev</em> for <em>heart</em>. The first words of the Israeli national anthem are
<em>Kol ohd ba-levav penimah</em>, which means <em>Everyone wants another of Penima’s latkes</em>. This shows that all that oil is really good for your heart and further that, when modern science disagrees with the Torah, the Torah is right.</p>

<p>In short, if G-dash-d had wanted us to eat hamantashen, not latkes, he or she would have had us fill them with carrots so that at least they would be good for our eyes.</p>
