        <p><em>Jerry Coyne <a href="https://whyevolutionistrue.com/2020/12/17/tonight-the-university-of-chicagos-world-famous-latke-hamentash-debate/">informs us</a> that the latke-versus-hamantash debate originated at the University of Chicago. He also reminds me that tonight is the last night of Chanukah, so I had better post this piece now. I wrote it years ago for the debate, Are Latkes Better Than Hamantashen? at my local synagogue. For those not in the know, latkes are a Chanukah delicacy: potato pancakes cooked in oil to represent the oil lamp that miraculously burned for eight days after the Maccabees rededicated the Temple. Hamantashen are triangular cookies eaten on the holiday of Purim (which is based on the Book of Esther).</em> Penimah <em>is a play on the Hebrew name</em> Peninah.</p>

<p>First, hamantashen are not kosher. (1) They have 3 sides, which symbolizes the Trinity.  (2) As if to drive the point home, they are filled with poppy seeds; these were originally popey seeds, from the Latin word <em>papaver</em>, which means true pope. (3) Finally, the word is really a corruption of Haman-<em>toosh</em>, and everyone knows that the hindquarters of an animal are not kosher.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the word for hamantashen in Hebrew is <em>oznay haman</em>, which means <em>Haman’s ears</em>. This means they give your children selective hearing and inspire them to poke holes in their earlobes (and maybe elsewhere).</p>

<p>Latkes are called <em>latkes</em> in Yiddish because they were developed by Lot, unlike Haman a righteous man and a nephew of my ancestor Abraham. The Hebrew word is <em>levivah</em>, which comes from the word <em>lev</em> for <em>heart</em>. The first words of the Israeli national anthem are
<em>Kol ohd ba-levav penimah</em>, which means <em>Everyone wants another of Penima’s latkes</em>. This shows that all that oil is really good for your heart and further that, when modern science disagrees with the Torah, the Torah is right.</p>

<p>In short, if G-dash-d had wanted us to eat hamantashen, not latkes, he or she would have had us fill them with carrots so that at least they would be good for our eyes.</p>

<em>This post consists of two statements reacting to the statement on teaching of evolution by National Association of Biology Teachers.  They are by Paul Braterman and Anj Petto.</em>
<p>
<h2>Statement by Paul Braterman</h2>
<p>
Biology teachers, especially in the US, often find themselves called upon to defend their teaching of evolution, on the grounds that it arbitrarily rejects the possibility of supernatural causes, and that since it is a theory it should not be taught as fact. The <a href="https://nabt.org/Position-Statements-NABT-Position-Statement-on-Teaching-Evolution"><strong>Position Statement from the National Association of Biology Teachers</strong></a> is meant to address such concerns. In my opinion, it lamentably fails to do so, and indeed gives ammunition to the enemies of evolution science.

<p>Natalie Hernandez in BugGuide identified the aphid as Macrosiphini, a “tribe” of aphids. She adds, “Tough to ID it further from this angle, the shape and texture of the head between the antennae (dorsal view) separates some of the similar genera. Reticulations on the siphunculi are important too but tough to see in photos, and this one isn’t helping by breaking the siphunculus that is in view.” The <a href="http://aphid.aphidnet.org/siphunculus.php">siphunculus</a> is a small tube for emitting pheromones; I have not the foggiest idea where the siphunculus is in this picture.</p>

        <p>In a discussion of the future of arguments with creationists and/or ID advocates, someone said there were no new arguments from them.  Here is my response, from an email.  It is mostly about the sort of ID arguments that I have paid most attention to.</p>
<p>
There have been attempts to come up with new versions of Dembski's arguments, from the Marks-Ewert-Holloway "Design Inference" axis.  But they are all somewhat vague and cannot be made explicit without it becoming clear how weak the arguments are.  Marks and Dembski have had an argument that on average "evolutionary searches" do no better than random guessing.  But they could do that only by including among the "evolutionary" searches as many that actively tried to get a bad result as there were ones that tried to get a good result.  Holloway and others also put forward arguments that Algorithmic Specified Complexity that is high because things are unusually non-complex (huh?) would be very rare among all possible bitstrings.  But they left it unclear why evolution should in some sense be trying to achieve that, and they made no argument about what natural selection would do with that measure.  There is also some rigorous math from George Monta&ntilde;ez of that group on how to unify a whole bunch of measures of specified complexity -- without ever exploring whether any of them help make an argument against the effectiveness of evolutionary processes.  There are also works by Marks and co. on "active information", which is, however, information that can be put into the genome by natural selection, so not at all a refutation of its involvement.
<p>
So ...
