        <p>In a discussion of the future of arguments with creationists and/or ID advocates, someone said there were no new arguments from them.  Here is my response, from an email.  It is mostly about the sort of ID arguments that I have paid most attention to.</p>
<p>
There have been attempts to come up with new versions of Dembski's arguments, from the Marks-Ewert-Holloway "Design Inference" axis.  But they are all somewhat vague and cannot be made explicit without it becoming clear how weak the arguments are.  Marks and Dembski have had an argument that on average "evolutionary searches" do no better than random guessing.  But they could do that only by including among the "evolutionary" searches as many that actively tried to get a bad result as there were ones that tried to get a good result.  Holloway and others also put forward arguments that Algorithmic Specified Complexity that is high because things are unusually non-complex (huh?) would be very rare among all possible bitstrings.  But they left it unclear why evolution should in some sense be trying to achieve that, and they made no argument about what natural selection would do with that measure.  There is also some rigorous math from George Monta&ntilde;ez of that group on how to unify a whole bunch of measures of specified complexity -- without ever exploring whether any of them help make an argument against the effectiveness of evolutionary processes.  There are also works by Marks and co. on "active information", which is, however, information that can be put into the genome by natural selection, so not at all a refutation of its involvement.
<p>
So ...

<figcaption> Penumbral eclipse of the moon, 2:40 a. m., MST, November 30, 2020.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>There was a <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/lunar/2020-november-30">penumbral eclipse</a> of the moon last night. During a penumbral eclipse, the moon enters the penumbra of the Earth’s shadow, rather than the umbra, or the deep shadow. Unless I am mistaken, if you were in the penumbra, on the moon, you would see a partial eclipse of the sun. At any rate, the penumbral eclipse was supposed to last from 12:32 a. m. to 4:53 and peak at 2:42, Mountain Standard Time, this morning. I went out with my trusty digital camera and a 210-millimeter lens at about 12:30 and 1:30, but I could see nothing, and the photographs revealed nothing. At 2:40, however, I exposed the photograph above. Although I adjusted the exposure using Affinity software, the image is not doctored in any way. You can see a darkening of the limb in the upper-right corner. Once I saw the photograph in the camera, I could see the limb darkening with the naked eye, but evidently my retina was overexposed slightly, because I had to squint to see it. Given my lack of success at 1:30, I forwent the opportunity to take a picture at 3:30 and retired.</p>

<p>I had the good fortune to see a <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2017/08/total-eclipse.html">total eclipse of the sun</a> and a <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2019/01/total-eclipse-moon.html">total eclipse of the moon</a> not very long ago. Unfortunately, the penumbral eclipse, though mildly interesting in principle, could not hold a candle to either of those.</p>

<p>Misconceptions about evolution abound, but rather too little is said about them.  I’d like to open a discussion here, in the comments.  In the slightly longer run, we could have a series of articles about them; I’d be happy to post these on behalf of their authors.  But first, it would help to have a discussion of what are
the most important, and most misleading, misconceptions about evolution.</p>

<p>Another good source of information on this is the <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/origins/faqs-evolution.html">Talk Origins Archive</a> which has quite a few excellent articles.  The most widely-cited is probably Doug Theobald’s outstanding “29+ Evidences of Macroevolution”.  Without detracting from the great service that the TOA is providing, it has been less actively updated lately.  So having some more discussions here seems like a good idea.  Perhaps we can compile a master list of misconceptions.  Let’s discuss.</p>

        <p>This post will supply some more technical details of my counterexample to
Mark Champneys’ arguments that approach of physical and biological systems
to equilibrium prevents natural selection from being effective.  The counterexample is explained in <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2020/10/does-approach-toward-higher-probability.html">my previous post</a>.  Below I
provide the relevant equations and some simulation results showing what
the effect of genetic drift will be.  To avoid taking up too much space on the
site’s front page, I will put most of that content “below the fold” …</p>
