<p>The term “Wow! signal” represents a decade-long mystery in astronomy: In 1977, the astrophysicist Jerry Ehman received a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wow!_signal">strong narrowband radio signal</a> on the frequency of the 21 cm line of hydrogen with the gigantic big-ear radio telescope in Delaware in the US state of Ohio. There seemed to be no natural explanation for the persisting 72 s signal from the Sagittarius constellation, which was 30 standard deviations above the background noise. The profile of the strong, narrow-band signal corresponds to that of a communication antenna. Its discoverer highlighted the signal on the printout with a red circle and added an expression of astonishment by noting “Wow!” In the period that followed, there was a lively debate among experts as to whether it was an artificially generated or a natural signal. Although objects like pul-sars seem to be a possible source, the controversy continues to this day.</p>

<p>A few years ago, a team of Kazakh scientists published a <a href="www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0019103513000791">paper</a> claiming to have discovered a Wow! signal in the genetic code of living beings. The code structure, so they claimed, is statistically so striking that its origin could be explained only by the presumption of an intelligent actor. The paper, published in Icarus, was somewhat off-topic since Icarus is a journal for planetary science rather than molecular biology or evolution. Since then, the paper has been celebrated as evidence for the extraterrestrial origin of the genetic code by support-ers of ancient astronauts and by the intelligent design movement; see, for example, <a href="https://evolutionnews.org/2013/03/a_wow_signal_of/">here</a>, <a href="https://uncommondescent.com/intelligent-design/extraterrestrial-life-genetic-code-as-wow-signal/">here</a>, and <a href="https://www.discovery.org/id/peer-review/">here</a>, as well as <a href="http://www.si-journal.de/index2.php?artikel=jg22/heft2/sij222-2.html">this arti-cle</a> in a German creationist journal. What’s it all about?</p>

<p>Oh dear, we jumped on this message too fast. Mr. Phelps now tells us,</p>

  <p>It looks as if the site is a well-done fake. Please don’t promote it. The copyright people at the distribution company are on it.</p>

<p>You may still, however,</p>

  <p>[c]onsider <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/reviews/B081S9Y898">rating it on Amazon</a> since creationists have been leaving inaccurate and negative reviews there misrepresenting the film indicating they probably didn’t watch it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some of them obviously watched it, some plainly did not, and some read into it what they wanted to see. I resisted reviewing the film on Amazon until over the summer, when I saw a spate of 1-star reviews by people who had plainly not seen the film. In case anyone is interested, I will post my own 5-star Amazon review, posted on August 25, below the fold:</p>

<p>Is creationism a conspiracy theory? Our colleague <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Braterman">Paul Braterman</a> of the University of Glasgow thinks so: In an article, <a href="https://theconversation.com/why-creationism-bears-all-the-hallmarks-of-a-conspiracy-theory-153831">Why creationism bears all the hallmarks of a conspiracy theory</a>, he notes creationist</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>claims that the scientific establishment promoting evolution is an arrogant and morally corrupt elite.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>This so-called elite supposedly conspires to monopolise academic employment and research grants. Its alleged objective is to deny divine authority, and the ultimate beneficiary and prime mover is Satan.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Creationism,” he adds, “re-emerged in this form in reaction to the mid-20th century emphasis on science education.” “Creationists go to great lengths to demonise the proponents of evolution, and to undermine the overwhelming evidence in its favour.” Further, they “immunise themselves from fact-based criticism. They label the study of the past as based on unprovable assumptions, thus disqualifying in advance the plain evidence of geology.”</p>

<p>I can add only that creationists have to think that everyone else thinks as they do, in terms of vast conspiracies; otherwise, it would be hard to imagine 99 % of the world’s biologists engaged in a gigantic conspiracy. But if <em>everyone</em> is involved in a conspiracy, ….</p>

<p>Mr. Phelps writes, “This is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_meteorite">lunar meteorite</a> about the size of a thumbnail. Most of the white mineral clasts are anorthite feldspar. The darker minerals include olivine, pyroxenes, chromite and spinel.  There could be minor amounts other minerals as well. The rock is described as a feldspathic regolith breccia. Basically, the rock is fragments of the lunar highlands (the feldspar), mixed in with other lunar material such as mare basalts via asteroid impacts. These meteorites are the only lunar samples legally obtainable by the general public. This specimen is North West Africa (NWA) 11273. It was excavated in Morocco or Algeria and bought by western dealers. It was obtained from <a href="http://www.meteoritemarket.com/">meteorite dealer Eric Twelker</a>.  For more details, including specific minerals and geochemistry, see <a href="https://www.lpi.usra.edu/meteor/metbull.php?code=66064">The Meteoritical Society page for NWA 11273</a>.”</p>

<figcaption><i>Lochmaeus manteo</i> &ndash; <a href="http://bugguide.net/node/view/418">variable oakleaf caterpillar moth larva</a>. Mr. Denelsbeck writes, "I was doing closeup images of the head of what was possibly a variable oakleaf caterpillar moth larva, when the flash brought up something curious. Apparently, between the translucent exoskeleton and the light angle, I got a glimpse of the internal anatomy of the caterpillar, but whether that is the actual brain or not I cannot say. I just liked the comic-book nuclear effect. The caterpillar measured 25&nbsp;mm overall, with the head being just 2.5&nbsp;mm in width." I stared at Mr. Denelsbeck's photo for a long time, incidentally, before I realized that the body is in the upper left, and the mouthparts, I think, in the lower right. If that is wrong, take me to task in the Comments.
