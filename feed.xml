&lt;p&gt;In a recent posting, &lt;a href=&quot;https://evolutionnews.org/2021/02/study-hands-of-ardi-indicate-a-chimp-like-tree-dweller-and-knuckle-walker/)&quot;&gt;Study: Hands of &quot;Ardi&quot; indicate a chimp-like tree-dweller and knuckle-walker&lt;/a&gt;, Casey Luskin of the Discovery Institute reports some of the findings from a recent re-analysis of the forelimb anatomy of &lt;i&gt;Ardipithecus&lt;/i&gt; and comes to the unsurprising conclusion that “Ardi” was not designed for obligate bipedal orthogrady, otherwise known as the way humans get around the world when forced to walk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He swings for the fences, telling us all reasons why these findings eliminate Ardi from its status as an ancestral hominin. However, his conclusions are based on common rookie mistakes about evolutionary science in general, and hominin evolution in particular. And so, the intention to hit the ball out of the park results in a disappointing strikeout reminding me of another &lt;a href=&quot;https://poets.org/poem/casey-bat&quot;&gt;well known Casey&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strike 1: Looking for Mr. Goodlink &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evolutionary science is not a search for specific ancestors that gave rise to specific descendants—even if occasionally it appears that we do find them. The proclamation that a specific fossil hominin—especially one from over 4 million years ago—is &lt;i&gt;the&lt;/i&gt; ancestor of our modern species is the stuff of press releases and news headlines, but not the serious study of paleontology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of what we can find—especially from millions of years back in our history—will be collateral relatives. Even though my paternal grandfather was removed from our family tree as a very young man, I can get a good sense of his physical characteristics because I knew his surviving relatives: his father, siblings, cousins, and nieces and nephews—his collateral relatives. Even though these relatives appear in a “side branch” relative to me, information about them allows us to sketch the history of our family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a similar way, what hominin fossils such as &lt;i&gt;Ardipithecus&lt;/i&gt; do is show us how and when ancestral members of our human family tree acquired certain morphologic traits that came to define the remaining surviving branch of the human family tree. The real question is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; whether there is some feature that reflects the arboreal habits of the last common ancestor (LCA) of humans and other African apes. Rather the question is what features are present in &lt;i&gt;Ardipithecus&lt;/i&gt; that are found only in the evolutionary branch leading to modern hominins. Even in the light of Ardi’s retention of some morphologic features well suited to suspensory locomotor behavior (movement characterized by hanging or swinging below branches of trees), Ardi still possesses traits commonly found in hominins, but not in chimpanzees or gorillas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is unlikely that Ardi is the direct ancestor of all modern humans, but the point is that this is not why Ardipithecus is of interest. Rather, Ardipithecus helps to tell us about the journey of our branch of the evolutionary tree from the last common ancestor (LCA) with the other African apes to modern humans. The greatest value of these specimens to that inquiry is in how they shed light on that journey—even if we never find the direct lineal ancestor of all modern humans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rookie mistake here is presuming that finding collateral relatives with key features different from our own means that they nullify any relationship among us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strike 2: Phylo-D’Oh&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luskin cites the paper in &lt;i&gt;Science Advances&lt;/i&gt; by T.C. Prang and others, &lt;a href=&quot;https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/9/eabf2474/tab-article-info&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ardipithecus&lt;/i&gt; hand provides evidence that humans and chimpanzees evolved from an ancestor with suspensory adaptations&lt;/a&gt;, which provides a morphometric analysis of features of several hand bones of &lt;i&gt;Ardipithecus&lt;/i&gt; compared with those of other primate species. What these results tell us is how the sizes, shapes, and proportions of these bones in &lt;i&gt;Ardipithecus&lt;/i&gt; compare to those in other primates that exhibit certain locomotor behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are important analyses that show us groups of primates that share similarities in morphology. When those similarities also match up with specialized locomotor behaviors, then they suggest that the “owners” of these morphologic features were probably adept at moving through their environments in the same way.  In fact, the analysis by Prang and others confirms, rather than refutes, one of the key conclusions of the first &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/326/5949/68&quot;&gt;comprehensive evaluations of the &lt;i&gt;Ar. ramidus&lt;/i&gt; remains&lt;/a&gt; by G. Suwa and others:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Ar. ramidus&lt;/i&gt; postcranium indicates both substantial arboreal capability and an intermediate form of terrestrial bipedality that preceded the more fully established  &lt;i&gt;Australopithecus&lt;/i&gt; condition.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Miocene apes that we infer gave rise to the last common ancestor of humans and African apes do not give a clear picture of the emergence of the branch that led to modern descendant species. Dryopithecines appear to have been generic apes without significant anatomic specializations for “hanging” by the forelimbs (suspensory progression or locomotor behaviors)—even though all the survivving non-human ape species have these specializations. Recent work by Böhme and others, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1731-0&quot;&gt;A   new Miocene    ape  and  locomotion  in the ancestor  of great  apes  and  humans&lt;/a&gt;, proposes another way of using suspensory morphology in arboreal settings: morphologic analysis of the remains of &lt;i&gt;Danuvius guggenmosi&lt;/i&gt; suggest that this species might have employed what the authors called “extended-limb clambering”—a form of movement combining standing upright with overhead grasping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These data suggest—but by no means prove—that the LCA of all modern apes probably relied on suspensory locomotor behaviors.  The key question here is why should we be surprised to see that heritage reflected in the anatomy of early hominins, especially if moving through or climbing in trees represented important behaviors for the first of our relatives to establish the hominin clade?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, if we actually watch the &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/lMC-0kG-SsM&quot;&gt;locomotor behavior of chimpanzees&lt;/a&gt;, even in the trees, we see a wide array of behaviors. Across wide trunks, chimps sometimes knuckle-walk as they do on the ground; walking on smaller tree limbs or climbing vertically, they wrap their hands around the surface; sometimes they stand and move along a branch on their feet while they reach overhead to grasp branches as they progress; and at other times, they hang below the branches and move by ricochetal brachiation—the classic “swinging from the trees” behavior popular culture associates with arboreal apes. Chimpanzees are clearly not limited to suspensory, below-the-branch locomotor behaviors (or to knuckle-walking), even if their hand and forelimb morphology are well suited for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As valuable as morphometric analyses are in helping us understand locomotor and positional behaviors, determining evolutionary relatedness, or phylogeny, is not simply a matter of anatomic or locomotor similarities. The critical data for determining the phylogenetic status of any fossil species is the appearance of anatomic features that are unique to specific branches of the evolutionary tree.  Showing anatomic similarity is not enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article by Prang and others also compared morphologic features related to suspensory locomotor behavior from species in vastly different primate clades—which means they do &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; share a recent common ancestor with the African apes. We see these anatomic changes in these species because the physical demands of similar environments often lead to convergent evolution of the features necessary to navigate the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a similar environment with similar opportunities and challenges for locomotion, primate species that are only distantly related show similar morphologies in the upper limbs. However, that does not mean that spider monkeys and gibbons are closely relatives that emerged from a common ancestor with these features, in the same way that, despite their overall morphologic similarities, we have no doubt that dolphins are not fishes, but mammals. Many anatomic and biomechanical similarities reflect environmental demands on the organism and these must be separated from those that unique identify members of different evolving lineages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rookie mistake here is using a “like-goes-with-like” classification scheme that relies on similar morphologic responses to environmental pressures rather than the features shared uniquely by members of the same branch of the evolutionary tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strike 3: “One of these things is not like the others”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chimpanzees (together with bonobos) are our closest living biologic relatives—but they are decidedly &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; our ancestors. Since the fossil record of African apes leading up to the time when the LCA is estimated to have lived (5‒7 million years ago) and for a long time afterward is limited, it is difficult to say what Ardi’s cousins were doing at the time and what they looked like.  But we can study contemporary descendants of the LCA, so that we can outline the trajectory of what had to change on the evolutionary journey from then to now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luskin’s conclusion that Ardi belongs on the chimpanzee and not the human branch of the family tree looks backward toward the LCA. He asks, in effect, “What features did Ardi have resembling those of the presumed LCA that are also shared with modern chimpanzees?” But to determine the proper phylogenetic placement of &lt;i&gt;Ardipithecus&lt;/i&gt;, we really need to look &lt;i&gt;forward&lt;/i&gt; to the anatomic changes found only in humans and not in the other apes. Only those can tell us whether this species belongs on our branch of the family tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, it is not just the lineage containing humans that has changed and evolved in the last 7 million years or so; the lineage containing chimpanzees has as well.  Even if, as seems likely, the LCA of humans and chimps relied on suspensory locomotor behaviors in moving through the trees, modern chimpanzee anatomy is not frozen in time. Modern chimps have highly specialized derived locomotor adaptations, just as humans do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider this: given the estimate of a divergence time between humans and chimps at 5‒7 million years ago, the estimated dates for the &lt;i&gt;Ardipithecus&lt;/i&gt; ramidus remains are no more than about 35 % (and possibly as little as 12 %) of the way along the road from LCA to the modern species. So if we had, as Suwa and others suggested, a primate retaining “substantial arboreal capability” while also being able to move effectively on the ground, how much anatomic difference from the LCA might we expect in the forelimb and hands? And how much would it vary from the anatomic changes that we would find in members of the chimpanzee branch of the evolutionary tree living at the same time as &lt;i&gt;Ardipithecus&lt;/i&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don’t have direct evidence in the fossil record to answer those questions definitively, especially for chimpanzees. But we do have direct fossil evidence to make it clear that it would take at least another 2 million years after &lt;i&gt;Ardipithecus&lt;/i&gt; until humans completed the transition in the skeletal features that we recognize today as the hallmarks of obligate bipedal orthogrady. In other words, Ardi is less than halfway through the transition from trees to ground, even for some estimates of an earlier time frame for the LCA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysis by Prang and others places the morphology of the &lt;i&gt;Ardipithecus&lt;/i&gt; hands closer to those primates that engage in suspensory behaviors. But it does not compare the features that are unrelated to arboreal locomotion. The early analysis by Suwa and others looked, for example, at features of the face and skull, for which Ardi shows several specific changes found only in humans. It should surprise no one who understands evolutionary science that some of those showed derived conditions found only in humans. Other features appeared in a form that was intermediate between those that characterize those found in modern humans and chimpanzees, and still others showed features that appeared relatively unchanged in descendants of the LCA and that we share today with the other African apes. This is how evolution works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Suwa and others placed those features known to have unique forms in humans on a continuum that included modern humans, fossil humans, and African apes, the values for &lt;i&gt;Ardipithecus&lt;/i&gt; were intermediate between those for modern chimpanzee species and australopithecines. These include changes in the skull and face that were less like those of chimpanzees and more like those that define australopithecines as humans. And one of these in particular—the relative position of the opening in the base of the skull for the connection to the spinal column (foramen magnum), which reliably indicates habitually upright positional behavior—is notably distinct from that of modern quadrupedal apes and intermediate between them and australopithecines—right where it should be for a member of an evolutionary lineage in transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not the only feature pointing forward to the hominid branch and away from the chimpanzee branch of our evolutionary family tree. In their &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/326/5949/64&quot;&gt;comparison of &lt;i&gt;Ardipithecus&lt;/i&gt; features&lt;/a&gt; with those of later hominins, White and others identified 66 features preserve well enough to judge their evolutionary affinities. Of these, they judged 33 to be similar to that of the LCA, 7 others to be intermediate between the LCA and those unique to hominins, and 26 to represent the derived condition found only in undisputed hominins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the appearance of uniquely derived traits that confer membership in a phylogenetic clade, regardless of what other features are shared with other evolutionary relatives, and this analsysis of Ardi showed a roughly 50/50 split in those features that mark the pathway from the LCA to the human, and not the chimpanzee, branch of the family tree. And this is true even—or perhaps especially—if not every feature is highly specialized for a particular behavior, even one as important as the human way of walking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rookie mistake here is to look at features that tell us mainly about navigating local environmental conditions with a suite of anatomic traits inherited from a recent ancestor, but to ignore those changes found in &lt;i&gt;Ardipithecus&lt;/i&gt; that relate to specific anatomic changes that make humans different from the other African ape lineages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ardi Wins in a Walk-Off&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Was &lt;i&gt;Ardipithecus&lt;/i&gt; a knuckle-walker like modern chimps and gorillas? The headline for Luskin’s article implies that Prang and others concluded that is the case. In fact, what they concluded was that the morphology of the wrist joint and the lengths of some of the segments of the digits were similar to that of knuckle-walking chimps. But they also point out that &lt;i&gt;later&lt;/i&gt; hominins retained some of these same features of the wrist, even though there is definitive evidence that these later descendants walked upright.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Ardi moved around as do modern chimps, was it because it had to or because it could? This is the main question. Humans walk upright; we are specialized to do so. However, we can climb, and we can swim. That is, we can use our bodies in ways that allow us to perform a variety of behaviors—including the quintessence of suspensory behavior, ricochetal brachiation—but we do not perform these actions as well as organisms that are especially modified to do them faster, more efficiently, and more powerfully than we can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could Ardi have used knuckle-walking? Prang and others suggest it is &lt;i&gt;possible&lt;/i&gt;, even though it is clear that its anatomical features do not require knuckle-walking. Could Ardi have walked upright? Other anatomic features and comparisons to the wide variety of locomotor behaviors in chimpanzees suggest this is also possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically what Prang and others tell us is that Ardi was not “designed for” obligate orthograde bipedal progression—and &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; that Ardi was not an early hominin species. More specifically, this analysis places &lt;i&gt;Ardipithecus&lt;/i&gt; closer to the presumed morphology of the LCA and as being less specialized for upright walking than is the case for later hominin fossil species. And at a point that early in the emergence of the humans from the LCA, is this finding really so surprising?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, and it is not more surprising than that Luskin, freshly returned to the Discovery Institute, has returned to his old pattern of misunderstanding and misrepresenting the scientific literature, based on a caricature of evolutionary science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book is entitled &lt;em&gt;Understanding Evolution&lt;/em&gt;, but it is perhaps as much about &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; understanding &lt;em&gt;of&lt;/em&gt; evolution and why some people do not understand it or refuse to understand it. In this essay, I concentrate  on “the understanding of,” or what I might call the meta-evolution parts of the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the second edition of the book; &lt;a href=&quot;http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2014/04/now-book-on-und.html&quot;&gt;John Wilkins reviewed the first on PT&lt;/a&gt; in 2014. It is a short book, well under 200 pages and 8 chapters, counting the unnumbered Concluding Remarks. The book is generally easy to read, with one exception that I shall note below. The early chapters especially have a lot of useful figures, mostly well annotated and well captioned. Many of them suffer from being in black and white, and look like they were originally prepared in color but never seriously adapted to black and white. The book ends with a useful summary of common misconceptions about evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is hard to categorize this book. The first three chapters concern the public acceptance of evolution, religious resistance to accepting evolution, and conceptual obstacles to understanding evolution. The fourth chapter gives a detailed example of Darwin’s “conceptual change,” in order to provide a description of someone gradually coming to accept evolution, as Darwin progressed from natural theology to natural selection. I was relieved that he showed a picture of Darwin more or less in his prime, rather than the somewhat conventional picture of an elderly man with a big white beard. I worry, though, that he may give too much attention to Darwin; creationists can mislead people into thinking that Darwin is our messiah and that evolutionary biology is a religion that has not shown any progress since 1859. Nothing, of course, could be farther from the truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next two chapters describe common ancestry and evolutionary processes. Though neither chapter is particularly difficult, they were in some ways written for biologists or biology students; this layperson could easily keep track of homologies and homoplasies, but began to slow down on apomorphies, plesiomorphies, synapomorphies, and symplesiomorphies. On the other hand, simple examples, such as the evolution of the name Nathan or the gradual transmutation of a pizza shop into a cookie shop, suggest that the book was written for laypersons, or at least for scientists in other disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final (numbered) chapter concerns the nature of science and includes a certain amount of philosophy of science, some of which was familiar, some not. The chapter demonstrates what Dr. Kampourakis calls the virtues of evolutionary theory, which include not only internal consistency, but also consistency with other theories such as physics and chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book says a great deal about creationism and the reasons people resist evolution. In chapter 1, after critiquing the way the Gallup and Pew polls asked their questions, Dr. Kampourakis turns to religious resistance to evolution. In particular, after informing us of the truism that not all religious people are creationists, he plots a graph (Figure 1.9) showing that people who are &lt;i&gt;unsure&lt;/i&gt; about evolution are more or less equally distributed among countries that are “more religious” and “less religious.” This conclusion is partly in contrast to the conventional wisdom that acceptance of evolution correlates negatively with religious belief (Figure 1.7). Here, despite an earlier, broader definition of creationism, and for the purpose of this discussion, Dr. Kampourakis limits “creationist” to mean anyone who thinks that humans were created in their present form within the last 10,000 years (page 10); doing so may classify some Biblical literalists (&lt;a href=&quot;http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2020/03/be-very-very-careful.html&quot;&gt;Gerald Schroeder&lt;/a&gt; comes to mind) among theistic evolutionists, and may skew some of his results in one direction or the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the second chapter, Dr. Kampourakis engages in a little epistemology. He makes a clear distinction between what you believe and what you know; I would add to that what you feel. He writes,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What matters for science is to have strong empirical grounding for our beliefs. Beyond this, one should believe what one wants.…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is in my view where the problem of religious resistance to the acceptance of evolution lies, at least in part. People do not easily distinguish between what they know and what they believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly many people confuse knowledge with belief, but I cannot agree that you should or even may believe whatever you want. I think, rather, that it is appropriate to think scientifically, so to speak, about even your nonrational beliefs. In particular, we do not &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; there is a god. We can adduce some evidence in favor of a god, but none of it, to my mind, is dispositive. When we say we believe in God, therefore, we really mean we &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; there is a god (seemingly inconsistent capitalization deliberate). Whether God interfered in any way with evolution is even more problematic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kampourakis concludes that people’s skepticism or uncertainty about evolution is not directly related to their religion or lack of religion. Rather, he says that we are bound by our intuitions and, among other things, conflate living organisms with human artifacts. Especially, we think that parts of organisms, if not organisms themselves, must have been provided for a purpose (wings are for flying). We thus see teleology where none exists. (That, of course, depends on how good your intuition is.) For this reason, Dr. Kampourakis warns against using the metaphor of design in biology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Dr. Kampourakis argues that we tend toward essentialism or, more precisely, psychological essentialism (as opposed to philosophical). In other words, we perceive that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;[c]ertain categories are real rather than human constructions, and they possess an underlying essence, which is responsible for why category members are the way they are and share so many properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, as a creationist might put it, “It is still a monkey!” Such thinking makes us resist the idea that one species can transmute into another, because the presumably fixed essences would have to change. In addition, essentialism may make us unaware of the very significant variation within a single species; this variation is often what drives evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a person who has occasionally been accused of scientism (a red herring if ever there was one!), I greatly appreciated the final chapter on the nature of science. In addition to a good introduction to the philosophy of science, Dr. Kampourakis introduces us to the limits of scientific thinking and concludes that some topics, such as the existence or nonexistence of God, are beyond the reach of science. I am inclined to agree with him, but I think that we can apply scientific thinking to the question, as discussed above. A discussion of theodicy may or may not have been appropriate here; the word appears only once, in the chapter on religious resistance, and is defined incorrectly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read the book on a Kindle Paperwhite. The figures were extremely difficult, and I had to view many of them on a computer. I thought surely that the figures in the print edition would be in color, but the Look Inside feature on Amazon showed only black and white. The graphs were intelligible, though mostly the font was too small. Many were bar graphs with two or more data sets. Some, in particular, Figure 1.9, mentioned above, may have been better as conventional line graphs, showing data points connected by line segments. Figures such as Figure 6.1, adaptation vs. exaptation, or 6.3, selection &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; vs. selection &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt;, while excellent figures, simply do not work well in black and white, especially with gray backgrounds. Those, among others, should have been revised so as to display better contrast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have only briefly touched upon some of the contents of this fine book. For more, I am afraid that you will have to acquire the book for yourselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, March 14, was Pi Day, and I learned today that several representatives introduced a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.congress.gov/117/bills/hres221/BILLS-117hres221ih.pdf&quot;&gt;RESOLUTION Expressing support for designation of March 14, 2021, as “National Pi Day”&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Whereas Pi can be approximated as 3.14, and thus March 14, 2021, is an appropriate day for &quot;National Pi Day&quot;: Now, therefore, be it &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Resolved&lt;/i&gt;, That the House of Representatives— &lt;br /&gt;

(1) supports the designation of a &quot;Pi Day&quot; and its celebration around the world; &lt;br /&gt;

(2) recognizes the continuing importance of the National Science Foundation’s math and science education programs; &lt;br /&gt;

and (3) encourages schools and educators to observe the day with appropriate activities that teach students about Pi and engage them about the study of mathematics.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bill was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/221/all-info&quot;&gt;introduced on March 11&lt;/a&gt;, which gave them 3 days to pass it. Guess where the bill is now….&lt;/p&gt;

Two recent developments give substance to my claim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, regarding the rules of evidence. We are familiar with the creationist claim that ancient-earth geology and the related studies such as the fossil record are mere historical sciences, based on unproven and unprovable assumptions about unrepeatable past events, whereas the scientific method requires reproducibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The errors here are obvious. The observations must, circumstances permitting, be reproducible, but the past event inferred need not be. For example, recent DNA evidence established that the father of the Archbishop of Canterbury was not the person named on his birth certificate. We can test this conclusion, to the highest scientific standards, by repeating the DNA test, but there is no need to beget additional Archbishops to prove our point. We do indeed assume, with Hutton, that the present is the key to the past, but this assumption is itself the result of repeated observation. We can see rain splashes in billion-year-old mudstone and rounded pebbles in ancient riverbeds. The resemblance between past and present is not, as creationists claim, an input into interpretation but an outcome of observation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this month the world’s most noted creationist organisation has gone even further.  In a piece titled &lt;a href=&quot;https://answersingenesis.org/apologetics/critical-thinking/thinking-critically-ape-man-messages/&quot;&gt;Thinking Critically About “Ape-Man” Messages&lt;/a&gt;, Patricia Engler of Answers in Genesis tells us “how to sort through such claims with biblical, critical thinking.” Her recommended procedure is dramatically effective: “The first way to detect a lie is by comparing it to the truth, with the ultimate standard for truth being God’s Word.” Unsurprisingly, this leads her to conclude, “Hominid claims fail this test.” The first test for truth, she tells us, is correspondence with AiG’s views. Whatever does not correspond to these views is not true. The insulation from criticism is perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted find out more about Ms Engler, but Answers in Genesis tells us &lt;a href=&quot;https://answersingenesis.org/bios/patricia-engler/&quot;&gt;tantalizingly little&lt;/a&gt;. We are told that after 12 years homeschooling, she completed a BSc with distinction at a liberal arts college, where “she studied intensely evolutionary courses to learn firsthand how Christian students can navigate secular education without compromising their biblical worldview,” but we are not told the subject matter of her BSc nor the identity of the college where she acquired these navigational skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the role of power in creationism, we have an example this week, when the Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools (Tracs) will have the status of its accreditations reviewed by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation. Joshua Swamidass has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-compromise-on-creationism-11614901537&quot;&gt;discussed the issues concerned in the Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt;, and Panda’s Thumb has covered Dr. Swamidass’s article &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2021/03/should-colleges-that-teach.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here I discuss Tracs as an instrument of power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to be accredited by Tracs, an institution must, &lt;a href=&quot;https://tracs.org/resources/&quot;&gt;as their website makes plain&lt;/a&gt; submit a Faith Statement which&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;should identify it as part of the evangelical protestant tradition in higher education. It is to be written so as to conform to the historic creeds and statements of Christianity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As to what those historic creeds and statements may be, they would seem to require compatibility with at least the spirit of Tracs’s own &lt;a href=&quot;https://tracs.org/statement-of-faith/&quot;&gt;Statement of Faith&lt;/a&gt;, which concludes with the following statements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biblical Creation&lt;/strong&gt;. Special creation of the existing space-time universe and all its basic systems and kinds of organisms in the six literal days of the creation week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Satan&lt;/strong&gt;. The existence of a personal, malevolent being called Satan who acts as tempter and accuser, for whom the place of eternal punishment was prepared, where all who die outside of Christ shall be confined in conscious torment for eternity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Readers may remember that Charles Darwin, in his Autobiography, expressed his repugnance towards the “damnable doctrine” of punishment of unbelievers, and that his widow wished to suppress his remarks on the grounds that &lt;a href=&quot;http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1497&amp;amp;viewtype=side&amp;amp;pageseq=89&quot;&gt;surely nobody really believed anything of the sort any more&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My present concern, however, is not with the content of this Statement of Faith, but with Tracs’s enforcement of it. Since its inception, Christianity has given rise to endless differences of doctrine and interpretation. Yet Tracs claims the right to determine which particular doctrines and interpretations an institution must adhere to, and which historic creeds and statements it must accept, before it will recognize that institution as Christian. Power indeed!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Paul Braterman</name></author><summary type="html">Last month I argued that present-day creationism is a conspiracy theory, that like other conspiracy theories, it has its own rules of evidence, and that one underlying driver for this conspiracy theory is a struggle for power.

Our colleague, Joshua Swamidass, writing in the Wall Street Journal, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-compromise-on-creationism-11614901537&quot;&gt;answers with a qualified yes&lt;/a&gt;. Specifically, the issue involves an accrediting agency known as Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools, or Tracs. Tracs was established in the 1970’s to provide accreditation for colleges and universities that taught young-earth creationism and six literal days of creation, rather than modern science. Eventually, Tracs was recognized by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation, or CHEA, which is in essence an umbrella agency that accredits accrediting agencies. The recognition of Tracs by CHEA is up for renewal this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But should Tracs colleges be accredited? Should Tracs be recognized? Dr. Swamidass thinks so but would require stringent conditions. To oversimplify his position, he thinks that colleges should be allowed to teach creationism, but if Tracs is to accredit them, then they must agree to teach modern science as well. He writes,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As a matter of academic freedom, scientists should tolerate institutions that teach creation science. But deviations from national norms in a science curriculum need to be prominently disclosed, tracked and reported. In practice, that means transcripts that clearly state which courses and degrees include creation science. Credit from courses that include creation science should not be used toward science degrees. Nor should they be eligible for transfer to secular institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Swamidass notes that the “public arena” is pluralistic and concludes,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;… Avoiding conflict by unconditionally renewing Tracs’ membership is an unacceptable approach. But we need a more constructive solution than simply excluding those with whom we disagree—even if they seem obviously wrong, as creationists do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The best solution is to respect Tracs institutions’ unique character while holding them to high academic standards. Insisting on policies of transparency and academic freedom might even lay the groundwork for change in future generations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The photographer was facing west, a short time, possibly as much as an hour, after sunrise. The mountain is illuminated by direct sunlight, but you can see the shadow of the mountain on which Dr. Dullien is perched. The top of the mountain looks reddish, in part because the rocks are red and probably in part because the sun is reddish early in the morning. In the shadow, the mountain is bluish because, well, because shadows are bluish because they are illuminated by scattered light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But why is the sky pink? The photograph of the mountain is sharp, so there is no aerosol to the west. I was stumped. For an answer, I checked in with Stephen Corfidi of the NOAA/NWS Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma. I discovered Dr. Corfidi through his splendid post, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.spc.noaa.gov/publications/corfidi/sunset/&quot;&gt;The Colors of Sunset and Twilight&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without going into detail, Dr. Corfidi thinks that the pink sky in the west is essentially a reflection of the red sky in the east, by the aerosols in the west. That is, the aerosols in the west are scattering (reflecting) some of the red light back eastward. The scattered light may be pink rather than red or red-orange if there are scatterers in the lower atmosphere, but that explanation gets a little messy. I am also going to guess that some blue sky resulting from direct sunlight peeks through and shifts the spectrum slightly to the blue, as well as possibly reducing the saturation of the back-scattered light.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Matt Young</name></author><summary type="html">Photograph by Vivian Dullien. Pink sky, February 20, 2021, approximately 7 a.m., Boulder, Colorado. The photographer was facing west, a short time, possibly as much as an hour, after sunrise. The mountain is illuminated by direct sunlight, but you can see the shadow of the mountain on which Dr. Dullien is perched. The top of the mountain looks reddish, in part because the rocks are red and probably in part because the sun is reddish early in the morning. In the shadow, the mountain is bluish because, well, because shadows are bluish because they are illuminated by scattered light. But why is the sky pink?

Lents authored an &lt;a href=&quot;https://skepticalinquirer.org/2021/03/behe-bias-and-bears-oh-my/&quot;&gt;article in the &lt;em&gt;Skeptical Inquirer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, telling the story of how we responded to Michael Behe’s last book. Specifically, in February of 2019, Michael Behe published the third book in his trilogy critiquing evolutionary science, &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/363/6427/590&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Darwin Devolves&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this book, Dr. Behe argues that adaptive evolution proceeds almost entirely by degrading or damaging genes. Even when evolution increases the fitness of organisms, it does so by destroying information in the genome, so evolution is a self-limited process that cannot explain the diversity of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The month before his book was published, in January of 2019, Richard Lenski, Nathan Lents, and I published &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/363/6427/590&quot;&gt;an 800-word review that was critical of &lt;em&gt;Darwin Devolves&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; together in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We expected a reaction from the Discovery Institute (DI).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There certainly was a strong reaction. In the ensuing weeks, the DI published &lt;a href=&quot;https://discourse.peacefulscience.org/t/darwin-devolves-the-end-of-evolution/4270&quot;&gt;over seventeen articles&lt;/a&gt;. In just days, they flooded search engine results with thousands and thousands of words written in response to us. These articles were written by Michael Behe himself and other scientists associated with intelligent design (ID).* Some articles were unsigned without identifying any authors by name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sort of “squid ink” response to criticism is surely unorthodox, but do not underestimate its effectiveness. It performs a particular public theater, one that benefits the DI in its quest to promote ID. The cloud of articles attracts attention. The DI and Behe can claim to have “responded” to all the criticism directed at them. Most non-scientists cannot follow the details or assess the quality of the responses. Some might interpret the exchange as a legitimate debate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This theater is normally where it ends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facing this ink cloud, most scientists just do not have the time or platform to respond. Most scientists find the flurry of articles off-putting, but the public might see evolutionary scientists abandoning a scientific debate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this &lt;em&gt;particular&lt;/em&gt; case, however, Dr. Lents and I anticipated what was coming. We were prepared. We did not have millions of dollars of funding and a team of staff.  But we did have the &lt;a href=&quot;https://discourse.peacefulscience.org&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Peaceful Science&lt;/em&gt; forum&lt;/a&gt;. That forum made all the difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The forum is fairly small, with only 50 or so active participants each day, but it is closely watched by several people in the origins debate. It is also an open forum, where anyone can join the conversation, adding information, expertise, and questions. As an open forum, it is also chaotic and unpredictable, not fully under our control. Still, it proved to be an effective platform, turning the tables on the DI’s typical public theater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DI had a turnaround time of days, but the forum had a far quicker turnaround, in minutes at best and hours at worst. Many of our contributors are scientists, and that became important. Quick analysis and rebuttal of DI articles was possible, at the moment when the public was watching, and these rebuttals did not depend on just the three co-authors of the &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DI did technically respond to our review in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;. On the forum, several of us explained in detail why their responses were not “responsive” and why they did not convince us. That response disrupted the story DI wanted to tell. In that way, we interrupted their theater and told a better story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is all true, but it doesn’t quite capture the beautiful experience we shared together on the forum. Here we were, a group of scientists with demanding day jobs, participating in several discussion threads and dissecting the science of polar bear evolution together. None of us had closely studied polar bear evolution before, and we may never have done so if not for &lt;em&gt;Darwin Devolves&lt;/em&gt;. So, on the forum, we held an &lt;em&gt;impromptu&lt;/em&gt; journal club on polar bear evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We began with the specific paper that Behe referenced in his book, but went beyond, doing some of our work with genomic data from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/&quot;&gt;National Center for Biotechnology Information&lt;/a&gt;. Each of us commented on each other’s contributions in real time, taking questions from the non-scientist readers as we went. There were doubts and disagreements, different expertise brought to bear, and even some messy discussion. The general public was able to look behind the curtain to see how scientists think through and work on questions like these.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one afternoon and evening, about eight of us did the homework that Behe should have done on polar bear genomics. This wasn’t just a discussion, we were doing science, &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; science, the same way we would tackle our own research questions, while the public looked on and asked questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This stands as a stark contrast to the DI. They did not and do not transparently reveal deliberations or disagreement. Instead, they present a united front, never publicly contradicting or criticizing each other. That is not how science actually works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we dug in more and more, a plant biologist, Arthur Hunt, recognized several serious problems with Michael Behe’s analysis of polar bear genetics in his first chapter. What began as a forum post by Dr. Hunt was quickly upgraded to a full-fledged &lt;a href=&quot;https://discourse.peacefulscience.org/t/lents-and-hunt-behe-and-the-polar-bears-fat/4473&quot;&gt;blog post co-authored by Drs. Hunt and Lents&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Behe responded with a blog post of his own, in which he called us “incompetent.” Surprising all of us, though, he doubled down by presenting data from the polar bear paper in a very misleading way. Just as important, his discussion revealed fundamental misunderstanding of the algorithms used to predict the function of mutations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This exchange was really important for several reasons. It certainly made it very clear exactly where Dr. Behe’s reasoning had gone wrong in a prominent example in his book. He could have conceded this example, without necessarily destroying his whole argument. But he doubled down instead. If a scientist can’t correct &lt;a href=&quot;https://discourse.peacefulscience.org/t/three-misrepresentations-on-darwin-devolves-back-cover/5237&quot;&gt;ancillary mistakes&lt;/a&gt;, why would anyone trust him to correct more important errors?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visible on the forum are several entertaining subplots within the larger story, far too much to cover here. The twists and turns were wild.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were more blog posts, of course, including a few from &lt;a href=&quot;https://telliamedrevisited.wordpress.com/2019/02/22/on-damaged-genes-and-polar-bears/&quot;&gt;Richard Lenski&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://peacefulscience.org/fair-hearing-behe/&quot;&gt;me&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The never-ending debate over ID can tax anyone’s patience and often seems pedantic. But the quick back and forth of a forum was different. With other scientists to help us along, responding to the DI felt more like play than pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DI still uses this same strategy, so we will not be the last to face the cloud of ink. Next time you are caught in the cloud, come join us at &lt;em&gt;Peaceful Science&lt;/em&gt;. Together we might succeed turning the theater around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we are lucky, we might even get to explore some interesting science together. It was polar bear evolution this time, but next time? I cannot wait to find out.  Whatever comes, I’m sure that we will have far more success tackling it together than alone.&lt;/p&gt;
