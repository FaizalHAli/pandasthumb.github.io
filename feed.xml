&lt;p&gt;Is creationism a conspiracy theory? Our colleague &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Braterman&quot;&gt;Paul Braterman&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Glasgow thinks so: In an article, &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/why-creationism-bears-all-the-hallmarks-of-a-conspiracy-theory-153831&quot;&gt;Why creationism bears all the hallmarks of a conspiracy theory&lt;/a&gt;, he notes creationist&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Creationism,” he adds, “re-emerged in this form in reaction to the mid-20th century emphasis on science education.” “Creationists go to great lengths to demonise the proponents of evolution, and to undermine the overwhelming evidence in its favour.” Further, they “immunise themselves from fact-based criticism. They label the study of the past as based on unprovable assumptions, thus disqualifying in advance the plain evidence of geology.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can add only that creationists have to think that everyone else thinks as they do, in terms of vast conspiracies; otherwise, it would be hard to imagine 99 % of the world’s biologists engaged in a gigantic conspiracy.

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It is rather easy to find examples of misconceptions about evolution and misinterpretations of scientific results. All you need to do is look at the latest articles at the Discovery Institute's site &quot;Evolution News &amp;amp; Science Today&quot;.  Case in point: their take on a recent paper by Stilianos Louca and Matt Pennell in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; last spring.  The paper is
this one:
&lt;p&gt;
Louca, S. and Pennell, MW. (2020). Extant timetrees are consistent with a myriad of diversification histories. &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2176-1&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2176-1&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It is behind a paywall, but the preprint version of the paper is
freely available at the Biorxiv preprint server here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/719435v2.full&quot;&gt;
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/719435v2.full&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The Discovery Institute's site is quite excited about this paper.  Their
report on 12 January (&lt;a href=&quot;https://evolutionnews.org/2021/01/controversy-arising-timetrees-unconstrained/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) announced that the paper announced something very dramatic:
&lt;blockquote&gt; Two theorists have caused a stir in evolutionary circles, claiming to have proven that Darwinian phylogeny efforts (tree-building) cannot be constrained to one “best” answer. In fact, any proposed tree is no better than an infinity of other trees. They can’t see the tree for the forest.  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now if true, this would call phylogenies (evolutionary trees) seriously
into question.  Can it be that Louca and Pennell have undermined the
foundation of reconstruction of evolutionary trees?  Or is it possible
instead that the folks at EN&amp;amp;ST have misread Louca and Pennell's paper?
&lt;p&gt;
Guess which is more likely? ...
&lt;!--more--&gt;
(no points for guessing from the title of this post that it is the EN&amp;amp;ST people who are wrong)
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;What the paper's authors assert&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Reading the Conclusions of the Louca and Pennell paper, we immediately see that
&lt;blockquote&gt;
We have shown that for virtually any candidate birth-death process, suspected of having generated some extant timetree, there exists an infinite number of alternative and markedly dierent birth-death processes that could have generated the timetree with the same likelihood. Without further information or prior constraints on plausible diversification scenarios, extant timetrees alone cannot be used to reliably infer speciation rates (except at present-day), extinction rates or net diversification rates, raising serious doubts over a multitude of previous estimates of past diversification dynamics.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In other words, the authors have a timetree, a tree for a set of species, with the
branching events on a time scale.  Their assumption is actually that the tree is entirely correct -- they are then evaluating from it what are the underlying rates of speciation (&quot;birth&quot; rates of lineages) and extinction (&quot;death rates&quot; of lineages). These rates are the &quot;diversification
scenario&quot;, not the tree itself.  Louca and Pennell argue that any one true tree is compatible with many different birth-death processes, and does not distinguish between them.
&lt;p&gt;
This is a somewhat shocking result, as it does call into question our ability to 
use a correct tree to infer the birth and death rates of lineages.  
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;What the Discovery Institute thought the paper meant&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Reading the coverage in Evolution News and Science Today, you'd get a very different impression: the paper is supposed to show that we cannot tell the difference between
phylogenies from the usual biological data used to infer them.  The paper does not
at all say that -- it says that the inferences that can be drawn from an entirely-correct tree do not specify the underlying speciation and extinction rates as narrowly as
previously thought.
&lt;p&gt;
EN&amp;amp;ST quotes the University of Oregon press release about the paper.  The U of O press release does get
the issue wrong, talking about &quot;flaws in how scientists build trees of life&quot; and how there are limits on how scientists can &quot;reconstruct evolution's path&quot;.  But the &quot;path&quot;
referred to is not the timetree itself -- it is the combinations of underlying birth and death rates of species that are compatibile with the correct tree.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt; Uncommon Descent chimes in &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The website Uncommon Descent, which is a cheering section for the Discovery Institute, of course cheered the DI's interpretation (in a post &lt;a href=&quot;https://uncommondescent.com/intelligent-design/darwinian-time-trees-dont-really-work/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). The UD post is signed by their commentator News, who is identified by UD as being Denyse O'Leary.  She is paid to generate posts for discussion there.  O'Leary, a skilled specialist in invective,
has some oft-repeated themes:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Science is mostly wrong, and so cannot be trusted, as demonstrated by publication scandals, failures of the
peer review process, failure to replicate statistically significant results, and particularly by scientists finding unexpected results of any kind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Scientific results, particularly any unexpected ones, show that &quot;Darwinism&quot; is wrong, and they can entirely be trusted when they do that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Even though UD lately has been spending most of its time on arguing that the U.S. presidential elections were
rigged, that the Covid-19 pandemic will not be serious and that hydroxyquinone is all that is needed, that Quantum Mechanics and Relativity validate the Shroud of Turin, that
consciousness cannot possibly be explained by evolution, that G&amp;ouml;del's mathematics proves the existence of God, etc., they did deign to take time out from these extraordinary efforts to
cheer &quot;News&quot; when she said that &quot;Darwinian timetrees don't really work&quot;, and that they are &quot;deeply flawed&quot;.  
&lt;p&gt;
In the ensuing discussion, commenter Orthomyxo repeatedly calls their attention to what the Louca and Pennell paper actually is about, that the EN&amp;amp;ST conclusion was not warranted, that the timetrees in Luca and Pennell's paper were in fact being taken as completely correct, and that the questions
Louca and Pennell raised were only about what could be known from correct trees about underlying birth-death rates.
&lt;p&gt;
But they will have none of it, pointing to the EN&amp;amp;ST post and to the University of Oregon press release, which appears to support that post.  None of them check Orthomyxo's assertions by actually going back to read the Louca and Pennell paper.  UD's commenters EDTA, Martin_r, PaV, Ralph David Westfall, ET, and EugeneS pile on, Orthomyxo sounding inreasingly astonished at their obtuseness.  In the last few comments the UD commenters fall back on taunting Orthomyxo about the obvious election conspiracy and the falseness of official statements about the Covid-19 pandemic.
&lt;p&gt;
Which is an ironic coda to their total misunderstandings about the Louca and Pennell paper.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joe Felsenstein</name></author><summary type="html">One of the figures from Louca and Pennell's 2020 paper.

&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2021/Shubin_Cover.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Book cover&quot; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just finished reading the latest book by Neil Shubin, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Some-Assembly-Required-Decoding-Billion/dp/1101871334/&quot;&gt;Some Assembly Required&lt;/a&gt;. I thought it was a splendid book and, besides this recommendation, will offer a few comments. If you want a detailed synopsis of the book, I suggest the &lt;a href=&quot;https://3quarksdaily.com/3quarksdaily/2020/03/some-assembly-required-by-neil-shubin-review.html&quot;&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; by my colleague Paul Braterman on the blog 3 Quarks Daily. 
&lt;em&gt;Some Assembly Required&lt;/em&gt; is a history of evolutionary biology from Darwin to the present, from fossils to DNA. Shubin takes a biographical or historical approach (or a biographical/historical approach) in much of the book, but his topic is largely an answer to the question famously posed by Darwin’s contemporary St. George Jackson Mivart: what would be the use, for example, of an incipient wing? How, for that matter, could a fish evolve fins for walking and lungs for breathing at the same time? As Shubin puts it,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If entire bodies have to change for any great transformation, and many features need to change simultaneously, then how could major transitions happen gradually?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That states the central problem of book, and Shubin spends the rest of his time solving it. The book is at root a science book, but sometimes it reads almost like a historical novel. I enjoyed the capsule biographies of many of the scientists, some of whom were familiar names and some of whom were not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was particularly interested in a segment about Linus Pauling and his colleague Emile Zuckerkandl. I found the chemistry somewhat hard to understand, particularly when Shubin referred to amino acid molecules as being charged (I understand now that they may have charged arms and of course they ionize in solution, but I still do not know precisely what charge was referred to). At any rate, Zuckerkandl, through a series of “connections,” not least a connection to Einstein, managed to escape Nazi Germany and ultimately to collaborate with Pauling, who was by then already well known. Pauling set Zuckerkandl to work on the proteins in hemoglobin. Zuckerkandl measured the mass and charge of various proteins and deduced that human hemoglobin was more closely related to ape hemoglobin than to frog or fish hemoglobin. He hypothesized that the similarity between human and ape hemoglobin was the result of evolution. Indeed, Pauling and Zuckerkandl inferred that “the more proteins of two species differed from each other, the longer the time those species have been evolving independently from a common ancestor.” If proteins evolved at a constant rate, then they could deduce when two species diverged; they had discovered the molecular clock, a concept that Shubin says was “utterly outrageous when it was first proposed[.]” The more I read, the more I wondered why I had never heard of Zuckerkandl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Zuckerkandl and his molecular clock were ignored, they were not alone. When Barbara McClintock enrolled in Cornell University, women were not allowed to major in genetics. Instead, she majored in horticulture and discovered her now-famous jumping genes in corn. Shubin shows that jumping genes are of critical importance for evolution, but no one paid attention when McClintock discovered them. Similarly, Lynn Margulis proposed that the organelles in eukaryotic cells were originally freely swimming bacteria or algae. According to Shubin, her paper received 15 rejections. Science eventually caught up with her, when it turned out that the DNA in mitochondria and chloroplasts was unrelated to the nuclear DNA of the cell itself. Francisco Mojica was likewise ignored when he discovered a mechanism that bacteria use to protect themselves against virus infections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you like salamanders and personal essays, you will love the chapter called “Loaded Dice” (I did). Shubin uses the concept of convergent evolution (a term he never actually uses) and shows that, for example, unrelated lizards on isolated islands develop similar morphologies and, as is more well-known, marsupials in Australia have evolved into marsupial wolves, flying squirrels, moles, and groundhogs, and even extinct lions, wolves, and saber-toothed tigers. He concludes,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The history of life is not wholly a crapshoot of contingent events. The dice are loaded by the ways genes and development build bodies, by the physical constraints of environments, and by history. In each generation, organisms have inherited recipes – written in their genes, cells, and embryos – to build organs and bodies. This inheritance … can make certain pathways of change more likely than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, in Stephen Jay Gould’s terminology, if we replayed (actually, re-recorded) the tape of life, we would get the same result. Here, I think he did not convince me; he rewound the tape only to, roughly speaking, the extinction of the dinosaurs. From then on, I grant, even if the asteroid had never struck, creatures similar to those we see today may have evolved, though I am less certain about technological beings. But what if we wound the tape back to the time before some eukaryote assimilated an algal cell, and that event never happened? Creatures today, I daresay, would look very different. Shubin quotes Lillian Hellman, “Nothing, of course, begins at the time you think it did.” I think perhaps he did not apply her dictum rigorously enough to the question of contingency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was also rather taken by the story of Susumu Ohno, a musician who likes to translate the structure of proteins into concert pieces. Ohno photographed chromosomes of mammals from shrews to giraffes, cut them out, and compared the chromosomes of these diverse species.  He noted that the numbers of chromosomes varied widely from species to species.  Then he got the idea to weigh the paper cutouts and discovered that the total weight of the chromosomes of each species was the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mostly, I thought that the science in the book was straightforward, and (apart from the discussion of amino acids) I understood it without difficulty. I was somewhat surprised when Shubin wrote that we have all descended from a sea squirt; surely that was too much of an oversimplification and he should have said common ancestor. In the same way, there was no need to avoid such terms as convergent evolution, exaptation, and maybe trace fossil; without those terms it might be hard for an inexperienced reader to seek further information. And, finally, I truly enjoyed the drawings by Kalliopi Monoyios; I thought some of them, however, such as the figures on pages 79 and 99, needed further explanation, possibly including labels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The editor in me thought there were very few puzzling or infelicitous comments or sentences, but I stumbled over the statement that the Jurassic was named “for its distinctive features.” It was actually named after the Jura Mountain range in France. The story of how &lt;em&gt;Archaeopteryx&lt;/em&gt; found its way into the British Museum was one of the more interesting anecdotes in the book, but I keep wondering who “the doctor” was.  I would not have minded another figure here and there, as when he describes “the classic pattern of one bone, two bones, wrist bones, and digits.” Words like metamorphosis and development should have been defined, not to mention decidual stromal cell.  A single, anodyne sentence regarding Linus Pauling and vitamin C seemed inadequate.  Shubin’s use of the term “selfish gene” was not precisely the same as the definition used by Richard Dawkins, and I thought that Shubin might have made a comment to that effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that I will leave with the final paragraph, which you might consider the bottom line,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When you know how to look, you can see billions of years inside the organs, cells, and DNA in all living things and relish our connections to the rest of life on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;

I thought it was a splendid book and, besides this recommendation, will offer a few comments. If you want a detailed synopsis of the book, I suggest the review by my colleague Paul Braterman on the blog 3 Quarks Daily. Some Assembly Required is a history of evolutionary biology from Darwin to the present, from fossils to DNA. Shubin takes a biographical or historical approach (or a biographical/historical approach) in much of the book, but his topic is largely an answer to the question famously posed by Darwin’s contemporary St. George Jackson Mivart: what would be the use, for example, of an incipient wing? How, for that matter, could a fish evolve fins for walking and lungs for breathing at the same time?

&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://abc7news.com/mlk-martin-luther-king-jr-nobel-prize-lecture/1163922/&quot;&gt;Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr.&lt;/a&gt; delivering his Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech. &lt;small&gt;ABC News, Channel 7, San Francisco; Associated Press.&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today is Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Day in the United States. This day, we remember the courage that was required to engage with racism in our society. The history here is both hopeful and discouraging. For all the progress made, much is left undone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some question why we should even address race on &lt;em&gt;The Panda’s Thumb&lt;/em&gt;, a blog devoted to defending evolutionary science. Perhaps this will just end into a contentious debate about the scientific particulars about the biological meaning of race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to talk about race. Still, we should find the courage to engage. The questions matter here. There are important things that can and should be said by us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to follow Todd Wood’s example. This summer, this young earth creationist asked, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://discourse.peacefulscience.org/t/todd-wood-is-evolution-racist/11287&quot;&gt;Is Evolution Racist?&lt;/a&gt;” Knowing this genre well, we should expect a diatribe of race-baiting, but that is not what Wood did. Instead, he took an honest look at his camp’s own history of racism, explaining how creationism has been used to justify racism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wood’s approach displays obvious integrity. His direct explanation of the history of racism in his own camp, to his own community, was not easy. It was not costless. He demonstrated courage, and in doing so sets an important example for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, much of the same reality is true of evolution too. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_racism&quot;&gt;There is a complex and troubled history of racism among evolutionary scientists&lt;/a&gt;. Evolution has often been used to justify false understandings of race and the evil of racism. It serves the common good to acknowledge this, to teach its history, and to model how to move past it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is difficulty in reckoning our history here. Dr. King has words for us. He was a theologian by training, but he also discussed science. In fact, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexknapp/2014/01/20/martin-luther-king-jr-on-science-and-religion&quot;&gt;he said quite a bit about science&lt;/a&gt;. In his Nobel Prize lecture, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/1964/king/lecture/&quot;&gt;King observes&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Yet, in spite of these spectacular strides in science and technology, and still unlimited ones to come, something basic is missing…We have learned to fly the air like birds and swim the sea like fish, but we have not learned the simple art of living together as brothers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be disagreements with the particulars of what he said of science and religion. Still, it seems that we should agree with him here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been more than 50 years since MLK was murdered. Over that half century, we certainly have not learned how to live together as a common family. Now, it is legal to integrate; the law does not force us to segregate. In that sense, we are desegregated. Yet we still live apart from one another. We have not managed well what MLK called the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.faculty.umb.edu/lawrence_blum/courses/318_11/readings/king_ethical_demands.pdf&quot;&gt;ethical demands for integration&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evolutionary science is important, in part because it brings us to grand questions about who we are and where we came from. Origins, at its best, brings us to the grand question of what it means to be human.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On this front, looking past our disagreements, it seems there is broad consensus among evolutionary scientists on these points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. There are &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/phc3.12468&quot;&gt;many definitions of race&lt;/a&gt;, especially if we include &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/phc3.12467&quot;&gt;folk and historical definitions&lt;/a&gt;. For that reason, we have to be careful about equivocation in the term &quot;race.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. Evolutionary science certainly &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; rule out many understandings of biology race, but perhaps not all of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. Some of the versions of &quot;race&quot; ruled out were quite prevalent in the past, including among evolutionary scientists. It is worth understanding why they were wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4. We now know that the human species is far more linked by interbreeding that we realized even just 50 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5. Even if biological races are real in some sense, that reality would not grant moral legitimacy to racism. Even as we debate the legitimacy of certain understanding of race, recognizing differences would not legitimize dehumanizing people based on those differences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6. There is, regrettably, a near total absence of African American scientists in evolutionary science, and in the biological sciences as a whole. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is much more I could say here, but these points of agreement seem like a good place to start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our points of disagreement, also, are important. I want to work through them. A full telling of evolutionary science includes the questions of race. These questions are difficult, in part &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; they extend beyond evolutionary science. The payoff is worth the trouble. The science here is interesting, and it can serve the common good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps, in a conversation among scientists, we can find a better way. The conversation is difficult for obvious reasons. We are faced with questions about our moral worth, dignity, and place in society. How we think about race matters. Scientists can and should be a model community for navigating the complexity here.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>S. Joshua Swamidass</name></author><summary type="html">Rev.

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; the other day posted an “op-doc,” or an op-ed in documentary-film format, concerning the “Ark” Park in Kentucky. I have received a handful of communications about this op-doc, and I have decided to plagiarize all of them. I will not identify the authors, but if they feel like identifying themselves, they can do so in the comments. The op-doc is available &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/05/opinion/noahs-ark-kentucky.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. It is behind a pay wall, but you may be entitled to access a few pages each month without a subscription. At any rate, I found a range of opinions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first person to contact me noted that the piece had been posted in the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; and called it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;[a]n uncritical free ad for the Ark Park disguised as an op-ed “documentary.” The NYT let this in as an “opinion” piece. It is directed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jeremyseifert.com/&quot;&gt;Jeremy Seifert&lt;/a&gt;. Seifert’s other work doesn’t appear to be aligned with fundamentalism; he does seem to have directed or produced a film attacking GMO foods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The remainder of the comments come from a listserv I subscribe to. A second person wrote, 
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The documentary doesn’t state a point of view overtly, but subtly conveys the incongruities of the place as a tourist attraction, as well as the silliness of the exhibits. It also conveys the humanity of the locals. Doing those things together is a pretty neat trick. And there’s more to the film than I’m saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And a third person:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Basically, it seems to make it clear that there was no “secular intent” in the approval and promotion of the Ark by proponents in Williamstown or in Grant County.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This was, for them, a part of their expression of faith and evangelism – the “tourist attraction” and economic development bits were a secondary motive, though they were used to justify putting a lot of public money and resources into the construction and infrastructure (and it is also clear that the economic boom never happened).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is also clear that there is a shared culture in the region – such that the people in the film cite biblical stories and recite passages that only make sense if people are already familiar with the biblical passages. The one that struck me was the mention of the 3 holy children[,]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt34.htm&quot;&gt;Daniel&lt;/a&gt; 3. I certainly did not see all of that in that film, and I thought that Person 3 might be reading more into it because of prior knowledge. At any rate, he then added,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I don’t entirely disagree with [the first person]. It is clearly uncritical of the whole operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But what it does do, IMHO, is to make clear that the support for the Ark and Creation Museum in Grant County, Williamstown, and Kentucky &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; religiously motivated and that the “economic development/tourism” promotion was little more than a cover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The economic legacy of the projects makes that clear – the “secular” authorities are still strongly in support despite the fact that none of the economic predictions have come to pass (and [Ken] Ham et al. backtracked on the issue, saying – I think this is made clear in &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2019/04/reviews-of-documentary.html&quot;&gt;We Believe in DInosaurs&lt;/a&gt; – that they never really &lt;em&gt;promised&lt;/em&gt; that these economic outcomes would happen).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But one would have to have context to see that underneath all the testimonials – and the film clearly does not provide such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, you may see a &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2019/11/we-believe-on-PBS.html&quot;&gt;slightly shortened version&lt;/a&gt; of the film &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pbs.org/independentlens/films/we-believe-in-dinosaurs/&quot;&gt;We Believe in Dinosaurs&lt;/a&gt; on PBS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If other people read things into the op-doc or thought it was kind of an anodyne commercial for the “Ark” Park, another person asked,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Is it just me? I thought it was crude and indeed insulting satire of a creationist. &lt;a href=&quot;https://answersingenesis.org/environmental-science/climate-change/im-climate-change-alarmist/&quot;&gt;Ham does believe in the fire to come&lt;/a&gt;, but do we want to go there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reference is to a web page where Ken Ham acknowledges the reality of climate change and then avers that “Jesus will return and the earth (and whole universe) will be judged with fire and God will make a new heavens and earth.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I was directed to &lt;a href=&quot;https://friendlyatheist.patheos.com/2021/01/06/this-short-film-about-ark-encounter-functions-as-an-unintentional-advertisement/&quot;&gt;This Short Film about Ark Encounter Functions as an Unintentional Advertisement&lt;/a&gt;, by Hemant Mehta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Mehta’s article is somewhat more wide-ranging than the title suggests, but he concludes,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, it functions as an unintentional advertisement for the Ark precisely because there’s nothing critical about it in the film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me? I did not read much into the film. I thought it was somewhat tedious and completely uncritically showed various people quoting the Bible, not to mention a mannequin. Granted that it was short, perhaps one-quarter the length of “We Believe in Dinosaurs,” but it seemed to me that it lacked the analysis and the counterpoint that we saw in “We Believe in Dinosaurs.” All in all, yes, an unintentional ad for the fake Ark. My Wife and Harshest Critic, however, thinks it was deliberately favorable, if not an intentional ad: It was not just uncritical, but downright laudatory, and it did not explore any of the implications of locating the “Ark” near Williamstown. A talented musician, she did not think the music helped the film along and was unimpressed when I told her that it was credited to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arvo_P%C3%A4rt&quot;&gt;Arvo Pärt&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Matt Young</name></author><summary type="html">Aerial view of the “Ark,” from the op-doc.

&lt;p&gt;Science bridges divides. That is the lesson enunciated by our colleagues &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_H._Lents&quot;&gt;Nathan Lents&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://swami.wustl.edu/&quot;&gt;Joshua Swamidass&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/columnists/nathan-h-lents-and-s-joshua-swamidass-the-lesson-of-kitzmiller-science-bridges-divides/article_829435cc-154f-5940-bf26-2456da663965.html&quot;&gt;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&lt;/a&gt; yesterday and earlier in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://triblive.com/opinion/nathan-lents-and-dr-s-joshua-swamidass-science-bridges-divides-for-a-better-world/&quot;&gt;Pittsburgh Tribune-Review&lt;/a&gt; on December 18.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The occasion? The fifteenth &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2020/12/where-were-you.html&quot;&gt;anniversary&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2005/12/unconstitutiona.html&quot;&gt;Dover decision&lt;/a&gt; by District Court Judge John E. Jones III “that it is unconstitutional to teach ID as an alternative to evolution in a public school science classroom.” December 20 has come to be known as Kitzmas, and the Panda’s Thumb &lt;a href=&quot;http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2005/12/unconstitutiona.html&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; by PZ Myers may be the &lt;a href=&quot;http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002718.html&quot;&gt;first use of that term&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is unusual about the Lents-Swamidass collaboration is that Prof. Lents is a professed atheist and Prof. Swamidass is an evangelical Christian (and indeed the proprietor of the blog &lt;a href=&quot;https://peacefulscience.org/&quot;&gt;Peaceful Science&lt;/a&gt; and the author of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07V4TBL5Z/&quot;&gt;The Genealogical Adam and Eve&lt;/a&gt;). Besides their own collaboration, which has led to speaking engagements “with audiences from the ‘liberal elites’ at Columbia University to the ‘biblically conservative’ at Concordia University,” they note the collaboration between Catholic biologist Kenneth Miller and “non-believer” Barbara Forrest at Dover. They further point out that, a year or so after the Dover decision, Francis Collins published his book &lt;em&gt;The Language of God&lt;/em&gt;, in which Dr. Collins attempts to reconcile his Christian belief with his acceptance of evolutionary science. (We discussed &lt;em&gt;The Language of God&lt;/em&gt; on Panda’s Thumb &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/07/francis-collins-3.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, when Dr. Collins was nominated to be director of the National Institutes of Health.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drs. Lents and Swamidass collaborated with Richard E. Lenski to pen a negative &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/363/6427/590.full&quot;&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; of the book &lt;em&gt;Darwin Devolves&lt;/em&gt; by Michael Behe in the journal &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; (behind a paywall, incidentally). They claim in the &lt;em&gt;Post-Dispatch&lt;/em&gt; article that they are risking their reputations by collaborating with each other. That may be so, but, as an accommodationist myself, I can only support their collaboration. Atheists need to understand that some people have a need to believe in a force greater than ourselves, and fundamentalists (for want of a better, general term) need to accept the findings of modern science and develop ways to integrate them with their religious beliefs. If collaborations such as Lents-Swamidass will encourage atheists to deal better with their religious friends, and fundamentalists to deal better with the reality of science, then I am all for such collaborations.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Matt Young</name></author><summary type="html">Science bridges divides.
