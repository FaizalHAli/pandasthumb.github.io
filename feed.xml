&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ark Encounter’s attendance for July, 2020, totals 57,632, according to a recent Kentucky Open Records Act (KORA) request. Of course this figure doesn’t include the hordes (eye roll) of children and lifetime members Ken Ham claims are pouring into the park and need not buy a ticket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest figure is a bit more than a third of some previous years’ July attendance figures (see the graph, above). This low number is understandable considering the current coronavirus pandemic. These numbers do not suggest any massive increase in attendance due to the opening of their new &lt;a href=&quot;https://arkencounter.com/virtual-reality/&quot;&gt;virtual-reality&lt;/a&gt; (virtual unreality?) theater adjacent to the Ark-shaped building. Apparently, in the new VR theater one can climb into a special “Truth Traveller” pod and don the latest high-tech VR glasses, then see Noah herding dinosaurs onto the Ark (ain’t “science“ and technology great?).  The VR show will cost $14.99 at present (supposedly this is an introductory offer; the price is going up soon) on top of the $49.95 adult ticket to see Mr. Ham’s fantasy. I suspect the VR glasses will be a nightmare to clean between showings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is hard to say whether they are hurting due to the coronavirus pandemic; Ken Ham’s fundraiser last spring to “reopen the Ark” netted well over $1.1 million. Moreover, Crosswater Canyon, the non-profit owned by the Answers in Genesis ministry, received between $1 million and 2 million in Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) money. Their gate receipts for 2018 and 2019, however, must have been in the $30-40 million range, and they will not achieve those receipts again for some time.&lt;/p&gt;

According to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/369/6505/756&quot;&gt;news article&lt;/a&gt; by journalist Linda Nordling of Cape Town South Africa, writing in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;, Africa&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;seems to have weathered the pandemic relatively well so far, with fewer than one confirmed case for every thousand people and just 23,000 deaths. Yet several antibody surveys suggest far more Africans have been infected with the coronavirus—a discrepancy that is puzzling scientists around the continent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/369/6504/624&quot;&gt;more technical article&lt;/a&gt; by Moustapha Mbow and colleagues, much of which I thought I understood, led to a similar conclusion. Several explanations have been proposed, including the simple fact that Africans are on the whole younger than, say, Europeans and Americans. The explanation may also be genetic. Another hypothesis, however, is that Africans are infected with various parasites, which ramp up their immune systems so that they can effectively fight new pathogens. Mbow and colleagues cite the “hygiene hypothesis” and suggest that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;early and chronic exposure to pathogens leading to relentless immune cell activation in harsh environments induces a strong regulatory immune response to counteract excessive inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I give succor to any anti-vaxxers, let me state that this hypothesis in no way militates against vaccinating for measles, mumps, chickenpox, pertussis (or whooping cough), polio, or all the other deadly childhood diseases that were commonplace when I was in grade school and do not appear every hundred years or so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A day or so after my physician advised me to get a flu shot, I ran across two articles, one by reporter Kelly Servick &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/08/how-will-covid-19-affect-coming-flu-season-scientists-struggle-clues&quot;&gt;in Science&lt;/a&gt; and another by reporters Lesley Wroughton and Max Bearak &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/south-africa-coronavirus-flu-season/2020/08/17/bd8aaaca-e084-11ea-82d8-5e55d47e90ca_story.html&quot;&gt;in the Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;.

  &lt;p&gt;The main explanation is that measures against coronavirus are having an impact on flu transmission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That explanation, if it holds up, will be good news to those who are concerned about a flu epidemic piggybacked on top of the current Sars epidemic.

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jonathan Kane&lt;/b&gt; is a science writer who has written five previous posts for Panda’s Thumb from 2016 to 2019 (they are listed in the Archives for those years). He is the editor and primary author of &lt;/em&gt;God’s Word or Human Reason? An Inside Perspective on Creationism&lt;em&gt;, co-authored with Emily Willoughby, T. Michael Keesey, Glenn Morton, and James R. Comer, published December 2016 by Inkwater Press, with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/1629016381/&quot;&gt;new edition&lt;/a&gt; published in spring of this year. Matt Young is this post’s moderator.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sad to announce that Glenn Morton, the geophysicist and former creation scientist who eventually became a critic of creationism, and who coined the term “Morton’s Demon”, died on August 5 after a long battle with cancer. He was 70.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of his geophysics career, Morton worked for several petroleum exploration companies, including ARCO, Oryx, and Kerr-McGee. Early in his career Morton was a young-Earth creationist, albeit one whose work required him to deal with vast amounts of geological data, and in the 1970s he became known as a creation scientist who sought ways of reconciling this data with young-Earth models. Morton’s 1980 paper “&lt;a href=&quot;https://crs-alchemy-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/pdf/crsq-1980-volume-17-number-3.pdf&quot;&gt;Prolegomena to the study of the sediments&lt;/a&gt;”, published in Volume 17, issue 3 of &lt;em&gt;Creation Research Society Quarterly&lt;/em&gt; (under the name “Robert Morton”), was the first creationist paper to raise the issue of how the relative thickness of sediment on continental platforms compared to that in oceans was a challenge to Flood Geology models. His 1982 paper “&lt;a href=&quot;https://crs-alchemy-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/pdf/crsq-1982-volume-19-number-2.pdf&quot;&gt;Fossil succession&lt;/a&gt;”, published in Volume 19, issue 2 of the same journal, raised several ways that traditional Flood Geology models cannot adequately explain the stratigraphic data, and introduced the alternative diluvialist model that’s now known as Recolonization Theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morton, who was not afraid to criticize other professional creationists for their lack of rigor, soon became known as a maverick among creation scientists. In Robert Schadewald’s summary of the 1986 International Conference on Creationism, published in Volume 6, issue 5 of &lt;em&gt;NCSE Reports&lt;/em&gt;, Schadewald describes a presentation by Morton titled “Geological Challenges to a Young Earth”. By this point Morton was what he called a “middle-Earth creationist” - someone who still sought to interpret the book of Genesis as literal history, but who recognized that a 6,000 year old Earth was incompatible with geological data. Morton’s presentation was negatively received by most of the conference’s other attendees, and Morton asked Schadewald (perhaps only half seriously) to “catch any tomatoes that came sailing over”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the end of the 1980s, Morton’s growing disillusion with the creation science community led to a complete withdrawal of publishing papers in that area - and eventually, by 1994, to his abandoning creationism entirely. From the 1990s onward, Morton was a prominent critic of creationist arguments in the field of geology, and his earlier years as a creation scientist gave him an intimate familiarity with these arguments. Morton’s transformation from a young-Earth creationist to a critic of creationism is described in his article &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.asa3.org/ASA/PSCF/2000/PSCF6-00Morton.html&quot;&gt;The Transformation of a young-Earth creationist&lt;/a&gt;, originally published in &lt;em&gt;Perspectives on Science and Christian Faith&lt;/em&gt; in June 2000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After his transformation, Morton regularly wrote criticism of creationist models for journals and websites related to the creation/evolution controversy, including &lt;em&gt;NCSE reports&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Perspectives on Science and Christian Faith&lt;/em&gt;, and the Talk.Origins website and newsgroup. Probably his most influential article is the one that coined the term “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.talkorigins.org/origins/postmonth/feb02.html&quot;&gt;Morton’s Demon&lt;/a&gt;”, which describes a type of confirmation bias that is particularly strong among creationists. Morton also is the author of what is arguably the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/geocolumn/&quot;&gt;definitive refutation&lt;/a&gt; of the creationist argument that the entire geologic column cannot be found in a single location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite his opposition to creationism, Morton never quite became a conventional evolution advocate. In his books &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=5UhHDwAAQBAJ&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Foundation, Fall and Flood&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (1995) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=80hHDwAAQBAJ&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adam, Apes and Anthropology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (1997), Morton presented the view that Adam and Eve were early hominins, and that the flood described in the book of Genesis was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zanclean_flood&quot;&gt;Zanclean flood&lt;/a&gt;, which filled the Mediterranean Sea basin 5.33 million years ago. In Morton’s view, the Zanclean flood is the only flood for which geological evidence exists that was large enough to match the description given in Genesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first got to know Glenn Morton in 2007, while I was working on my own book criticizing the creationist movement, &lt;em&gt;God’s Word or Human Reason?: An Inside Perspective on Creationism&lt;/em&gt; (the first edition is available &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Gods-Word-Human-Reason-Perspective/dp/1629013722&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and the recently released second edition is available &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/1629016381/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). I invited Morton to write the book’s chapter about stratigraphy because I considered him the most qualified person to critique creationist arguments in that area. Morton’s chapter for this book, eventually published in December 2016, was his final anti-creationism publication. The book also republished, in slightly expanded form, Morton’s personal account of his abandonment of young-Earth creationism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the book’s publication date neared, Morton informed me that he was becoming increasingly disillusioned with the anti-creationism movement and took down his personal website, where many of his writings could be found. He explained to me that although he still opposed YEC and stood by his earlier arguments against it, he was upset by the way people had begun using his writings to attack religion in general, which was a use of his writings that he did not approve of. However, he continued to support my book project, because the book took a clearly defined neutral stance with respect to religion, and after its publication he told me that the eventual product lived up to his expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morton’s final book, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Eden-Was-Here-Evidence-Historicity-ebook/dp/B08F2Z7Z5H&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eden Was Here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, was published only a few days before his death. This book seeks to identify the location of the Garden of Eden from an evolutionary and old-Earth standpoint. As a Christian theistic evolutionist, Morton placed a great deal of importance on reconciling details from the book of Genesis with geological and evolutionary science. In a &lt;a href=&quot;http://themigrantmind.blogspot.com/2019/06/why-historicity-is-important.html&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; from June 9 of this year, Morton explained why he considered it important for people and events discussed in the Bible to have a historical basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of PT’s readers who think of Genesis as a collection of myths, or as a moral and spiritual text that was not intended by its author to have a historical basis, may regard this endeavor as having been a waste of time. But it is impossible to deny the importance of Morton’s criticism of creationist models, or his importance as the most prominent example ever to exist of a professional creation scientist who eventually abandoned creationism. While I personally disagree with many of Morton’s ideas about the intended meaning of Genesis with respect to the Garden of Eden and the Flood, I also find something to admire in his determination to come up with his own set of models that matched his beliefs. Until the end of his life, Morton never was willing to let anyone else pressure him to change what he believed, whether that pressure came from creationists or anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jonathan Kane</name></author><summary type="html">Glenn Morton, 1950-2020.

Reed has been working to fix that, and I have been adapting the site to be served by Github Pages.  This
has been possible since it was already using a locally-served version of Github Pages since 2016,
in its previous configuration.

Currently most features of PT work.  The comments do not appear at the end of articles, even though

&lt;p&gt;The title of this article, &lt;a href=&quot;https://evolution-outreach.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12052-020-00126-8&quot;&gt;Teaching evolution in U.S. public schools: a continuing challenge&lt;/a&gt;, seems to me a little sterile and possibly unduly pessimistic. The main conclusions of the article are given in the figure: The fraction of teachers who teach evolution has increased from 50 to nearly 70 % in the 12 years since an &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0060124&quot;&gt;earlier survey&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, the fraction who teach creationism has fallen, and the fraction who give “mixed messages” has fallen precipitously, from the low 20’s to the low teens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among other conclusions, the authors credit the Next Generation Science Standards for the improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article is too detailed to regurgitate here, but it is easy to read (and free!). The authors, for example, compare responses from teachers in states that have adopted the NGSS or a similar &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nap.edu/catalog/13165/a-framework-for-k-12-science-education-practices-crosscutting-concepts&quot;&gt;Framework&lt;/a&gt; with teachers in the remaining states before crediting NGSS with the improvements. They looked at other data to conclude that the improvements were not the result of new teachers being hired after &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitzmiller_v._Dover_Area_School_District&quot;&gt;Kitzmiller&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; and NGSS. Rather, older teachers, on the job before &lt;i&gt;Kitzmiller&lt;/i&gt;, took advantage of professional-development courses and improved their teaching of evolution and increased the time they devoted to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the fraction of teachers who “strongly disagreed” with the statement, “I emphasize that intelligent design is a valid, scientific alternative to Darwinian explanations for the origin of species,” increased from 20 to 43 % in the 12 years between the polls. Likewise, the fraction who strongly disagreed with the statement, “I emphasize that many reputable scientists view creationism or intelligent design as valid alternatives to Darwinian theory,” increased from 13 to 20 %. Only 3 % “strongly agreed” with the either statement, a number that remained constant across the 12 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, I thought it was a pretty good decade or so.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Matt Young</name></author><summary type="html">&quot;Teachers classified by the scientific accuracy of the messages reportedly conveyed to students, 2007 and 2019.&quot; Note, in particular, that the number of teachers who teach evolution as settled science has increased from around 50 to nearly 70&amp;nbsp;%, whereas the number who give mixed messages or outright teach creationism has decreased.

&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2020/Ham_Racism_Cover_600.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Book cover&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other day I received an e-mail from AIG, advertising a number of books that appear to be about racism, including, in particular, &lt;a href=&quot;https://answersingenesis.org/store/product/biblical-answer-racism&quot;&gt;The Biblical Answer to Racism&lt;/a&gt;, by Ken Ham. The book was offered to me for $0.49, which was waived if I inserted a certain code. I found that I already had an account with AIG, so “buying” the book was trivial, and it came essentially instantaneously as a pdf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biblical answer to racism, I am happy to report, is that there is no such thing as race. As Mr. Ham writes,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;All&lt;/em&gt; human beings in the world today, however, are classified as &lt;em&gt;Homo sapiens sapiens&lt;/em&gt;. Scientists today admit that, biologically, there really is only one race of humans. For instance, a scientist at the [American Association for the?] Advancement of Science Convention in Atlanta stated, “Race is a social construct derived mainly from perceptions conditioned by events of recorded history, and it has no basic biological reality.” This person went on to say, “Curiously enough, the idea comes very close to being of American manufacture.” [Italics in original.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, after the mandatory attack on evolution, quoting Stephen Jay Gould out of context, and claiming that &lt;em&gt;On the Origin of Species&lt;/em&gt; is an inherently racist document, because many people who followed it were racists. The argument, which is kind of irrelevant, is close to the genetic fallacy, but we need not get into that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Biblical Answer to Racism&lt;/em&gt; is essentially a pamphlet, 39 pages long. It has a fairly clear and I assume correct description of how different varieties of melanin make us come in different shades. (I had no idea that blue eyes were the result of light scattering rather than pigment, which perhaps accounts for why my eyes appear as different hues in different environments.) It argues that we should not use the term &lt;em&gt;race&lt;/em&gt; at all and opts instead for &lt;em&gt;people group&lt;/em&gt;, perhaps because &lt;em&gt;ethnic group&lt;/em&gt; has already been taken. Mr. Ham also takes pains to debunk the argument that his biblical namesake, Ham, the putative ancestor of the black people groups, was cursed (Gen. 9:18-27) – an argument that has been used in the United States to justify slavery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The dispersion at Babel” and its consequences are a significant fraction of the pamphlet. Mr. Ham “explains” that after the dispersion at Babel, people groups, um, evolved different features, such as skin color. Skin color, however, is not to be confused with race, and he has noted earlier that differences &lt;em&gt;within&lt;/em&gt; people groups greatly exceed differences &lt;em&gt;among&lt;/em&gt; people groups. We are, after all, all descended from Adam. Therefore, so-called interracial marriage is not prohibited. Intermarriage between Christians and non-Christians, however, is another matter; non-Christians are “dead in trespasses and sin” (I have no idea what that means, but it does not sound complimentary).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Ham’s bottom line or lines seem to be the quotation above and the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;1. There is no biblical justification for claiming that people from different so-called races (best described as people groups) should not marry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

2. The biblical basis for marriage makes it clear that a Christian should marry only a Christian. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
When Christians legalistically impose nonbiblical ideas, such as no interracial marriage, onto their culture, they are helping to perpetuate prejudices that have often arisen from evolutionary influences. If we are really honest, in countries like America, the main reason for Christians being against interracial marriage is, in most instances, really because of skin color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The church could greatly relieve the tensions over racism (particularly in countries like America), if only the leaders would teach biblical truths about our shared ancestry ....&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Ham is not free of prejudice against non-Christians. Nevertheless, I have to give him a lot of credit for producing this document, because I have a suspicion that a great many of his right-wing, evangelical Christian followers may be inherently racists (birthers, for example), and Mr. Ham has done us all a great service by opposing racism in terms that they can perhaps appreciate.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Matt Young</name></author><summary type="html">The other day I received an e-mail from AIG, advertising a number of books that appear to be about racism, including, in particular, The Biblical Answer to Racism, by Ken Ham.
