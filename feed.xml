Mark Champneys’ arguments that approach of physical and biological systems
to equilibrium prevents natural selection from being effective.  The counterexample is explained in &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2020/10/does-approach-toward-higher-probability.html&quot;&gt;my previous post&lt;/a&gt;.  Below I
provide the relevant equations and some simulation results showing what
the effect of genetic drift will be.  To avoid taking up too much space on the
site’s front page, I will put most of that content “below the fold” …&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Population genetics theory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The model had a very large (effectively infinite) population of haploid organisms, for which we are following 100 sites in their DNA.  Mutation is symmetrical among all
four possible nucleotides at rate  &lt;em&gt;u&lt;/em&gt;, with each mutational event equally likely
to result in each of the other 3 possible bases.  We are following the frequency
of the C allele at each site.  It has fitness a fraction &lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt; greater than the three other nucleotides, which have fitness &lt;em&gt;1&lt;/em&gt;.  So the fitness of C is &lt;em&gt;1+s&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each generation starts by producing a large number of offspring, with mutation
happening at that time.  So if the fraction of all copies of the site that have C is
&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;, after mutation a fraction &lt;em&gt;u&lt;/em&gt; of those have changed to another base, and
a fraction &lt;em&gt;u/3&lt;/em&gt; of the non-C bases have changed and become C.  Thus the
frequency of allele C is then &lt;em&gt;p’&lt;/em&gt;, where&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;p’ =  p(1-u) + (u/3)(1-p)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then these individuals undergo natural selection.  &lt;em&gt;(1-p’)&lt;/em&gt; of the copies are
non-C bases, and &lt;em&gt;p’&lt;/em&gt; of the copies are C.  As these have fitnesses &lt;em&gt;1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;1+s&lt;/em&gt;,
their numbers after selection will be proportional to  &lt;em&gt;(1-p’)&lt;/em&gt;  and  &lt;em&gt;p’(1+s)&lt;/em&gt;,
so that the fraction of copies that are C will then become&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;p’(1+s) / ((1-p’) + p’(1+s)),&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;p’(1+s) / (1 + p’ s).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applying these two formulas in that order, we get after a full generation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(p(1-u) + (u/3)(1-p)) (1+s) / (1 + (p(1-u) + (u/3)(1-p)) s )&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we have reached the equilibrium gene frequency, this is again &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;, so
that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;p  =  (p(1-u) + (u/3)(1-p) )(1+s) / (1 + (p(1-u) + (u/3)(1-p)) s ).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiplying through by the denominator and collecting terms, after some struggle
we end up with the quadratic equation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;s(1-(4/3)u) p^2  +  p( (4u/3) - s + (5/3)us)  - (u/3)(1+s)  = 0&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solving this for  &lt;em&gt;u = 0.0001&lt;/em&gt; and  &lt;em&gt;s = 0&lt;/em&gt;, we get  &lt;em&gt;p = 1/4&lt;/em&gt;, the obvious answer from
the symmetry of the mutational model.  When &lt;em&gt;s = 0.005&lt;/em&gt;, the equation becomes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;0.004999333 p^2 - 0.00486583333 p - 0.0000335  =  0&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;whose positive root is the equilibrium frequency,  &lt;em&gt;p = 0.980133157&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simulations showing the effect of genetic drift&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the 100 sites are far enough apart to have noticeable levels of recombination
between them, and if their fitnesses combine multiplicatively, then each site can be regarded as evolving independently.  If the population size is not infinite but, say, 20,000 then we can use a single-locus genetic simulation program such as the teaching program PopG produced by my laboratory.  It is a Java application that can be downloaded from the site  &lt;a href=&quot;https://evolution.gs.washington.edu/popg/popg.html&quot;&gt;https://evolution.gs.washington.edu/popg/popg.html&lt;/a&gt; at our webserver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The program is for a diploid population, but by making the diploid population size be
10,000 and making the fitnesses of the genotypes be powers of &lt;em&gt;(1+s)&lt;/em&gt;, it will give the same results as a haploid population twice the size and with fitnesses &lt;em&gt;(1+s) ; 1&lt;/em&gt;.  So I ran the program with 5 independent populations and 10,000 diploid individuals per population, and fitnesses of &lt;em&gt;AA&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Aa&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;aa&lt;/em&gt; of  &lt;em&gt;1.010025 : 1.005 : 1&lt;/em&gt;, and this is equivalent to having &lt;em&gt;20,000&lt;/em&gt; haploid individuals with fitnesses &lt;em&gt;1.005 : 1&lt;/em&gt; for &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
We have mutation rate from &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; to non-&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; of 0.0001 and from non-&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; of one-third that value,
&lt;em&gt;0.000033333&lt;/em&gt;.  Note that in these cases allele A stands in for the selectively favored base, C.
The figure below shows two runs, each with 5 populations, which is equivalent to following 5 sites:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2020/champneys3.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We see the mutational equilibrium in the absence of natural selection on the left,
and the effect of selection with mutation in the figure on the right.  The smooth blue
curve shows what would have happened without genetic drift.  With a larger population
the individual sites would have remained closer to the smooth blue curves.
The 50 individual sites will vary in gene frequency, as these 5 do,  The result will
be distributions a bit wider than the original  binomial distributions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Without genetic drift&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a very large population, where we can ignore genetic drift, each site has the
frequency of the C allele change.  At any generation, all 100 sites will have equal
gene frequencies.  Thus the distribution of the numbers of C’s in the haploid
genomes will follow the binomial distribution, with 100 trials, each with a probability
of C that is 1/4 (if there is no natural selection) or each with a probability of C
that is 0.980133157.  The state of the population will be a binomial distribution of
the number of C’s,  and this distribution will either approach an average of 25 C’s or an average of 98.0133157 C’s, depending on whether there is not or is natural selection.  Like an idealized gas, the individuals will vary randomly, but the distribution of their properties will be a distribution that changes deterministically, from generation to generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like gas in a container that is evenly distributed when there is no gravity, but collects at the bottom of the container if the whole thing is placed in a strong gravitational field, the population approaches an equilibrium which is different whether there is or is not natural selection.  And that simple fact disproves the statements Mark Champneys made in his video about movement towards equilibrium preventing natural selection from having any long-term effect.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joe Felsenstein</name></author><summary type="html">This post will supply some more technical details of my counterexample to Mark Champneys’ arguments that approach of physical and biological systems to equilibrium prevents natural selection from being effective.

Ms. Garrett, a distinguished science journalist and the author of the apparently prescient 1995 book, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Coming-Plague-Emerging-Diseases-Balance/dp/0140250913&quot;&gt;The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World out of Balance&lt;/a&gt;, is not quite as optimistic as the stock market regarding Pfizer’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-announce-vaccine-candidate-against&quot;&gt;recent announcement&lt;/a&gt; of a potentially successful coronavirus vaccine. So I looked up Ms. Garrett’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/11/10/the-vaccine-news-is-good-heres-the-bad-news/&quot;&gt;recent article in &lt;em&gt;Foreign Policy&lt;/em&gt; magazine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ms. Garrett seems generally pessimistic, because cases are surging, the United States has roughly one-fifth of known cases worldwide, and possibly one-third (!) of the population will probably refuse a vaccine, once one is available. Though optimistic that President-Elect Biden has appointed a Covid task force, she also notes that the present lame-duck administration will be in charge for more than two months and the presidential scientific advisor, Scott Atlas, advocates “what amounts to a do-nothing approach to Covid-19 control” (as we noted &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2020/11/are-creationists-dictating.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Ms. Garrett foresees a “mass exodus” of health officials from the government this fall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about the vaccine? Ms. Garrett says,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But let’s be clear about what this Pfizer study shows so far: For 90 percent of the volunteers who got the vaccine (as opposed to a placebo), SARS-CoV-2 infection did not occur for a study period of seven days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Seven days&lt;/em&gt;. Nothing more is known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If that protection turns out to be durable for, say, a full year, the Pfizer vaccine might be deemed a spectacular success. But nobody is going to wait a year to find out. The moment the FDA approves the product, Pfizer says in its press release, “we expect to produce globally up to 50 million vaccine doses in 2020 and up to 1.3 billion doses in 2021.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vaccine, however, is made of messenger RNA and as such “is unlike any vaccine ever used, for any disease.” It requires storage at a temperature of -103 °F (or -75 °C in God’s units) – well below typical refrigeration temperatures, and there is apparently a shortage of dry ice (-78 °C).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://cspinet.org/news/beyond-the-curve/causes-for-hope&quot;&gt;generally positive article&lt;/a&gt; praising President-Elect Biden’s Covid-19 task force and also his plan to ensure, among other things, that “public health decisions are made by public health professionals,” Peter Lurie of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cspinet.org/&quot;&gt;Center for Science in the Public Interest&lt;/a&gt; observes that the claimed 90 % is well beyond the minimum requirement of the FDA. He wants to know, however,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;How many cases were in the treated and placebo groups? How serious were the cases? How many people have been followed in the trial and for how long? How big is the vaccine’s safety database and what does it show?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and, in particular, he notes that Pfizer&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;pointedly declined support from Operation Warp Speed, [and] may not be subject to the same constraints upon pricing that those who signed up for the program might feel obligated to follow.&lt;/p&gt;

We just received an article, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rightwingwatch.org/post/exclusive-far-right-creationists-are-setting-trumps-virus-response/&quot;&gt;Far-Right Creationists Are Setting Trump’s Virus Response&lt;/a&gt;, by Matthew Sheffield, which suggests precisely that. Mr. Sheffield’s article is posted in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rightwingwatch.org/&quot;&gt;Right Wing Watch&lt;/a&gt;, a “project” of the progressive organization People For the American Way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Sheffield begins by noting that Mark Meadows, Mr. Trump’s chief of staff, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/25/politics/mark-meadows-controlling-coronavirus-pandemic-cnntv/index.html&quot;&gt;told Jake Tapper of CNN&lt;/a&gt;, “We are not going to control the pandemic … because it’s a contagious virus” (does he think we could control it better if it were a non-contagious virus?). Mr. Meadows may or may not be a creationist, but he is certainly a fellow traveler: At one time, he &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/mark-meadows-and-the-undisclosed-dinosaur-property&quot;&gt;purchased a piece of property&lt;/a&gt; on which an &lt;em&gt;Allosaurus&lt;/em&gt; specimen had been discovered (supposedly by some home-schooled children). He then sold the property to Answers in Genesis, arguably in order to keep the fossils under the control of young-earth creationists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Vice-President, Mike Pence, heads the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Coronavirus_Task_Force&quot;&gt;White House Coronavirus Task Force&lt;/a&gt;. On August 8, 2016, Mr. Sheffield reminds us, Mr. Pence said, in a somewhat rambling &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4617037/user-clip-mike-pence-evolution&quot;&gt;speech on the floor of the House&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I believe that God created the known universe, the earth, and everything in it, including man. And I also believe that some day scientists will come to see that only the theory of intelligent design provides [an] even remotely rational explanation for the known universe, but until that day comes and [sic] I have no fear of science. I believe that the more we study the science, the more the truths of faith will become apparent. I just would humbly ask, as new theories of evolution find their ways into the newspapers and into the textbooks, let us demand that educators around America teach evolution not as fact but as theory. And an interesting theory to boot.
But let’s also bring into the minds of all of our children all of the theories about the unknowable that some bright day in the future, through science and perhaps through faith, we will find the truth from whence we come[.] [Lightly edited from a user clip, not recorded by C-Span.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be hard to argue that Mr. Pence was not a creationist, though conceivably not a young-earth creationist. In the statement above, contrary to Mr. Sheffield, he did not claim “that science is too changeable to be trusted, and that schools should also teach that humans were ‘created’ by God in their current form,” though he certainly mentioned all the old creationist shibboleths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.stanford.edu/scott-atlas&quot;&gt;Scott Atlas&lt;/a&gt;, the White House’s advisor on Covid-19, appears to have been a fairly prolific neuroradiologist before he joined the Hoover Institution, a right-wing think tank. Mr. Sheffield is impressed by the fact that Dr. Atlas is in turn impressed by&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;the COVID-19 mitigation proposals of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Gilder&quot;&gt;George Gilder&lt;/a&gt;, co-founder of the Discovery Institute, a Seattle-based think tank that specializes in promoting supply-side economics, climate science denial, and “intelligent design,” a spit-polished version of creationism which focuses more on attacking “Darwinism” than promoting biblical fundamentalism. According to Atlas, Gilder’s recommendation to “defer as much as possible to the principles of freedom” was “right on target.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Sheffield details how Mr. Gilder “has also applied his particular blend of junk economics and junk science” elsewhere, but I want to concentrate on Dr. Atlas. Dr. Atlas is not a virologist, an infectious-disease specialist, or an epidemiologist. Nevertheless, he has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/02/us/politics/trump-scott-atlas-coronavirus.html&quot;&gt;advising the White House&lt;/a&gt; to let the virus run its course and rely on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02948-4&quot;&gt;herd immunity&lt;/a&gt;, while protecting “vulnerable populations.” As far as I can determine, no true experts, not least Anthony Fauci, Deborah Birx, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/stanford-colleagues-warn-dr-scott-atlas-fosters-falsehoods/story&quot;&gt;78 of his former colleagues&lt;/a&gt; at Stanford Medical School agree with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But he is he a creationist? Neither the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; article nor his Wikipedia entry hints that he is a creationist of any kind, let alone a young-earth creationist, which I think is what we mean when we use the term unadorned. At most, Mr. Sheffield has established, in his case, a kind of guilt by association, and the association is mostly with Mr. Gilder and the Discovery Institute, not Mr. Meadows and Mr. Pence. Even so, it seems to me that a creationist is not necessarily wrong about everything else, nor is every so-called libertarian necessarily in favor of inaptly applying a political position, such as “the principles of freedom,” to a medical problem, such as Covid-19.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, Mr. Meadows and Mr. Pence may be creationists, depending on your definition. But if Mr. Sheffield is trying to connect Dr. Atlas to creationism, broadly construed, it seems to me that he is on the wrong track: the connection is both tenuous and irrelevant to Dr. Atlas’s position on Covid-19. I think that Dr. Atlas is wrong because he is wrong, and not because he has colleagues who are creationists. And I think I will leave it at that.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Matt Young</name></author><summary type="html">Are creationists dictating Covid policy?

&lt;figcaption&gt;Interview, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltmhpG8fydM&quot;&gt;Michael Behe: Kafka at the Dover trial&lt;/a&gt; with Joshua Swamidass and Michael Behe.
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our colleague Joshua Swamidass &lt;a href=&quot;https://peacefulscience.org/dover-behe/&quot;&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; on the blog Peaceful Science that he was interviewed yesterday along with Michael Behe. I have not yet had a chance to watch the interview, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltmhpG8fydM&quot;&gt;Michael Behe: Kafka at the Dover trial&lt;/a&gt; (actually, I am hoping for a transcript), so I will merely note that Dr. Behe apparently compared the Dover trial to the book &lt;em&gt;The Trial&lt;/em&gt; by Franz Kafka. I have read &lt;em&gt;The Trial&lt;/em&gt; and also much of the transcript of the Dover trial, and I find that claim astonishing though, as I said, I have not actually seen the interview yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At any rate, here is part of what Dr. Swamidass has to say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;…The Dover Trial was one of the central and defining events of my time in graduate school. So this was a remarkable opportunity for me, a chance to talk directly with one of the key participants in this moment of history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Mike and I certainly have our disagreements. Nathan H. Lents, Richard Lenski, and I reviewed his last book, &lt;em&gt;Darwin Devolves&lt;/em&gt;, a couple years ago. It was not a positive review. But I actually agree with Behe on more than most people expect. In the end, Intelligent Design looks like a “garden path” to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The tension between our agreement, on the on hand, and our disagreement, on the other, makes conversation with Mike exciting for me. We are both Christians that believe God created humans through a providentially governed process of common descent. We also do not see clear biochemical evidence for God’s guidance in human evolution. So where exactly do we disagree? Honestly, on human evolution, I am not exactly sure. Maybe you can help us figure out that puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The exchange in this conversation was fun. We discussed Irreducible Complexity too. I explain why I’m not convinced by his argument, and Behe agreed to give [a] look at and respond to what I’ve written about this in the past. We wondered about the meaning of Darwinism, and tussled over the right understanding of “exaptation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;…The Dover Trial was a flash point of conflict, but this dialogue certainly seemed like peaceful science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then he adds, “Kafkaesque indeed.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the quotations above, I have omitted several links, but you may get them from the link in the first line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the Peaceful Science post contains a link to another interaction between Drs. Behe and Swamidass, this one at Texas A&amp;amp;M, entitled “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXU2Z3GVNFM&quot;&gt;God and/or Evolution?&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Matt Young</name></author><summary type="html">Interview, Michael Behe: Kafka at the Dover trial with Joshua Swamidass and Michael Behe.

&lt;p&gt;In his video, which we have discussed &lt;em&gt;ad nauseam&lt;/em&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2020/09/are-evolutionary-biologists-ignoring-science.html&quot;&gt;our
extremely long recent thread&lt;/a&gt; Mark Champneys claims that
scientists are ignoring science when they claim that natural selection can
result in functional information increasing in the genome.  In the subsequent
discussion, Champneys insisted that there was a generalized form of the Second
Law which made such increase impossible, insisted that it applied not just to
isolated systems but to non-isolated populations of organisms, and that it
did prevent natural selection from achieving long-term improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In this post, I hope to show a very simple example, and to get away from
the issue of whether this has anything to do with the Second Law.  If we
can focus on discussing whether the approach of a stochastic process to its
equilibrium prevents natural selection from having effect, maybe we
can avoid having 1,600-plus comments and actually discuss the matter at hand.
&lt;p&gt;
Let's try for that focus and relevance.  Surely someone who wants scientists
to actually grapple with the science must agree with that goal.  Right?  Let's
see ...
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;The example&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My simple example will be a large population of organisms, haploid ones, for
simplicity.  We will follow 100 sites in their DNA.  At each site there are
four possible bases, A, C, G and T.  There will be a simple mutational
process which changes symmetrically among the four possible bases
(technically, a Jukes-Cantor model of change).  Each base has the same
probability of mutating, and when it mutates it changes to one of the other
three bases, chosen at random.  We'll take the probability of mutation to be
0.0001 per base per generation, a fairly high value.
&lt;o&gt;
No matter what the population of sequences is, as mutations accumulate,
the population proceeds towards its equilibrium.  Each site becomes
equally likely to have all four bases, and this happens independently
at all 100 sites.  The equilibrium has all 4^(100) possible sequences,
equally frequent.  If we were to follow only how many copies of one of the
four bases, say C, the sequence has, each site has a 25% chance of having a
C.  So on average there will be 25 Cs.  It will be like coin tosses of a
biased coin, with 100 tosses, on average 25% of which are Heads.  This is a
binomial distribution.  In the figure above, it is the orange histogram,
which varies around 25.  If having lots of Cs were somehow desirable, with
only mutation, the sequences are stuck in the vicinity of 25, forever.
&lt;p&gt;
The process of change of these sequences is a random process (a stochastic
process), and it has a single equilibrium distribution toward which it
proceeds.  In technical terminology, this is an ergodic process.
So far things look as if they follow Mark Champneys' rules.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;With natural selection&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
But notice what is left out -- natural selection.  So let's consider
another case, which puts it in.  Suppose that at a site, having a C
improves the fitness of the individual by 0.005, which is one part
in 200, or 0.5%.  And suppose that this happens at all the sites.
For simplicity we'll suppose that the higher fitness is always
for C, with all three other bases having the equal, slightly lower fitness.
The fitnesses at the different sites combine by multiplying.  So
the fitness of a 100-base genotype is 1.005, raised to the power
of the number of Cs in those sites.
&lt;p&gt;
It will not be a big surprise that Cs increase at each of the
sites.  I'll leave out the algebra, but can supply it on request.
Starting out with a population gene frequency of 0.25 at all 100
sites, the gene frequencies are always the same at all of the sites,
but they rise gradually.  After about 5,000 generations. they
rise almost to 1, settling in to an equilibrium gene frequency
of 0.9801332.  They don't get all the way to 1, because mutation
has continued, and Cs keep mutating away from C as well as being
selected towards it.
&lt;p&gt;
In the figure, the result is the green histogram.  There are an
average of 98.01332 Cs in these 100 sites.  The number varies around that
from genome to genome, just as tosses of 100 coins would that have a Heads
probability of 0.9801332.  It is possible to show that the average
fitness of genomes in that equilibrium distribution is 1.630472.
Natural selection shifts the equilibrium distribution dramatically
to the right.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Mark Champneys is right (and also wrong)&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yes, in both of these cases the random process results in an equilibrium
distribution, toward which the process moves.  But note -- &lt;em&gt;they
aren't the same distribution in the two cases.&lt;/em&gt;  Natural
selection has a dramatic effect on what the equilibrium
distribution is.  So the movement towards an equilibrium does
not mean that natural selection is ineffective.
&lt;p&gt;
I will be interested in seeing whether Mark Champneys agrees with
this.  His video gives the distinct impression that
both cases are expected to have the same equilibrium distribution,
with natural selection therefore being ineffective.  That would
seem to require some changes in the video, and some acknowledgement
that maybe evolutionary biologists are not quite as ignorant
of science as Mark Champneys said they were.


&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/o&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joe Felsenstein</name></author><summary type="html">In his video, which we have discussed ad nauseam in our extremely long recent thread Mark Champneys claims that scientists are ignoring science when they claim that natural selection can result in functional information increasing in the genome.
