&lt;p&gt;
 In a famous scene in &lt;em&gt;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&lt;/em&gt;, King Arthur and his knights encounter the menacing figures of The Knights Who Say &quot;Ni&quot; (pronounced &quot;nee&quot;).  The word
 is so unhearable that Arthur and his men fall back in anguish, covering their ears.  Ultimately, they are allowed to pass, but only after providing those Knights with what they want, &quot;a shrubbery&quot;.
  &lt;p&gt;
    If you thought that the scene was farfetched, think again.  At &lt;em&gt;Evolution News and and Science Today&lt;/em&gt; their anonymous commentator (Casey Luskin? David Klinghoffer?), in an article about the giraffe genome, &lt;a href=&quot;https://evolutionnews.org/2021/05/giraffe-genome-is-not-evolutionary/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;complains about an equally unhearable word&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  After interpreting the evolution of the giraffe as brought about by Design rather than by evolutionary processes, the real complaint comes out:
    &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;!--more--&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Bad “Evolutionary” Habit&lt;/h3&gt;

Throughout these articles, one can see the writers inserting the adjective “evolutionary” in front of everything. 
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; “an evolutionary geneticist at the University of Copenhagen” — why not just a geneticist?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; “giraffes are a poster child for evolutionary oddities” — why not just oddities?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; “several phenotypic traits that share evolutionary constraints” — why not just constraints, as in engineering specifications?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; “This [reduction in olfactory sensitivity] may be an evolutionary consequence of enhanced vision” — why not just a consequence, as in a designed trade-off for multiple competing specifications?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; “evolutionary adaptations” — why not just adaptations, or unique traits fit for the giraffe’s ecological niche?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; “evolutionary pleiotropy” — why not just pleiotropy?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; “a suite of traits are changed within a short evolutionary time” — why not a suite of traits that work together?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Typists could avoid carpal tunnel syndrome by eliminating this unnecessary word in science papers and news stories. 
It seems that the “evolutionary” biologists, who should just call themselves biologists, want to push a narrative
that everything in the living world must pay tribute to Darwin. The repetition of the word hammers it into people’s
heads. Everything in nature, they are taught with this propaganda tactic, is part of a fluid phantasmagoric 
tableau where every creature came from some other creature and is becoming something else. 

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
And here I had thought that the Discovery Institute was now OK with using the word &quot;evolution&quot;.  After all, they
have often explained, everything changes, and that is all that &quot;evolution&quot; means.  It is only when natural selection is invoked that
they become unable to acknowledge those changes.  And, it turns out, when common descent is inferred.  Their love affair with &quot;change&quot;
seems to always end there.
&lt;p&gt;
So now we seem to be back to an earlier era, when species were assumed to be fixed.  Even Young Earth Creationists seemed lately 
to have invoked extremely rapid evolution so as to turn the limited number of &quot;kinds&quot; that would fit on the Ark into all present-day species in a few hundred years.
But now the Discovery Institute announces that, whatever the amount of change, the word &quot;evolution&quot; is unhearable.
&lt;p&gt;
Well, I am an evolutionary biologist, because that's what I work on -- the processes of evolution and the history of life that results. 
And I guarantee you that evolutionary geneticists, evolutionary genomicists, evolutionary anthropologists, evolutionary physiologists, evolutionary developmental biologists,
and evolutionary molecular biologists are going to keep using that word, no matter how unhearable it is to the Discovery Institute. We will investigate
evolutionary rates, evolutionary correlations, evolutionary tradeoffs, and much more.
And there is no &quot;shrubbery&quot; that will change that.

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A high-school English teacher once told our class that “higher education is a process of learning more and more about less and less.” Catchy and memorable, but only true to the extent that most of our careers—academic and otherwise—tend to make us “experts” on a limited number of topics. So it is inevitable that we will confront some information that is outside our expertise, and we will need to make judgments about arguments, actions, or policies based on this information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, journalist Nicholas Wade authored a &lt;a href=&quot;https://thebulletin.org/2021/05/the-origin-of-covid-did-people-or-nature-open-pandoras-box-at-wuhan/&quot;&gt; piece in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists&lt;/a&gt; about the origin of SARS-CoV-2—the coronavirus that is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic—giving credence to the claim that the virus was leaked from a laboratory in Wuhan (China) instead of emerging from a natural reservoir such as local bat populations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those who have expertise in the details of laboratory research with viruses can certainly evaluate and critique the claims that Wade presented in support of his argument. But what about the rest of us? How do we evaluate arguments with important consequences without resorting to “dueling experts” who claim equal authority and come down on opposite sides?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a challenge for all of us who deal with claims and evidence outside our own expertise and experience. Even if we don’t know an exon from Exxon, we need a way to evaluate how much credibility to give particular arguments, such as this piece from Nicholas Wade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we teach the basics of reading research literature to students, we expect that, at first, they lack the specific disciplinary expertise necessary to critique the content effectively. So we help them to develop an approach that looks for clues in the source, the format and presentation, the language and appeal, the purpose, and other characteristics of the argument that we can identify without having a deep grasp of the technical details of a specific field of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A simplified &lt;a href=&quot;https://writingcenter.tamu.edu/Students/Writing-Speaking-Guides/Alphabetical-List-of-Guides/Citing-Documenting/Evaluating-Scholarly-Sources&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt; provided by the Writing Center at Texas A&amp;amp;M University uses the C.R.A.P. acronym to help students focus on revealing indicators of credibility of persuasion pieces such as the one on the source of the COVID-19 pandemic. These are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
•	Currency: Is the information up to date; has it been supplanted or refuted by newer resources?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
•	Reliability: Is the information reviewed or vetted by people with specific expertise in a relevant field? Does it represent the consensus of that field, a commonly acknowledged alternative to the consensus, or a position rarely accepted by those most knowledgeable?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
•	Authority: Is there a specific author whose qualifications to identify and evaluate relevant evidence and to place it in context can be verified? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
•	Purpose: Does the author or publication have a particular goal or mission to explore issues in a certain way or from a certain perspective, and is it intended more to persuade or to inform? Most of this information is readily available from the source, whether it is a periodical or a web site. We teach students that sources that do not provide this information are automatically suspect. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember: This is not an approach that attempts to evaluate the technical details of the argument, but one that looks at the context in which the argument is made and the way that it is presented and supported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currency: Wade’s article is recent, but the information used in it goes back up to a decade, and it is not clear whether issues raised and inferences and conclusions reached and reported early in the pandemic are still current. Have they been re-evaluated, modified, or even retracted in the light of newer information?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reliability: The publication’s policy for vetting or reviewing technical information is not clear. It does not classify this article as to content and intent. Is it news? Investigative reporting? Opinion? The article seems intent on persuading us of a position, rather than merely informing us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Authority: The author, Nicholas Wade, has a good record as an “explainer” of things scientific. He worked for years at the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; and has some good collections of articles that are useful for high-school and introductory-college level readers and that give a good overview of established science. His credentials as a science journalist are well established, but Wade is not a virologist or a microbiologist or an epidemiologist. He is a journalist, albeit one with a specialty in scientific—particularly biologic—topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result is that Wade has to rely on published reports and interviews of scientists in the relevant fields. This is not a bad thing—one should get one’s information from these sources—but it is difficult to evaluate Twitter feeds, interviews, and other media except via an appeal to the authority of those who are quoted in these sources (see reliability above).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Purpose: In this case the mission statement of the &lt;i&gt;Bulletin of Atomic Scientists&lt;/i&gt; tells us that its focus is on threats to existence caused by humans. So its articles are going to emphasize things that humans do that threaten human life on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://thebulletin.org/about-us/&quot;&gt;Our Mission&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
The Bulletin equips the public, policymakers, and scientists with the information needed to reduce man-made threats to our existence.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the themes of the publication is to highlight threats posed by technologies that we do not or cannot control properly; a major theme of this article is the potential for accidental release of laboratory-engineered viruses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;About Us&lt;br /&gt;
At our core, the Bulletin is a media organization, publishing a free-access website and a bimonthly magazine. But we are much more. The Bulletin’s website, iconic Doomsday Clock, and regular events help advance actionable ideas at a time when technology is outpacing our ability to control it. The Bulletin focuses on three main areas: nuclear risk, climate change, and disruptive technologies. What connects these topics is a driving belief that because humans created them, we can control them. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the very least, this is a publication that is going to be more sympathetic to explanations about “threats” that are caused by humans (intentional or otherwise). In this case, part of the argument is that laboratory technologies used in the study of viruses are endangering humanity and the world, at least in part because of shortcuts taken by researchers, research laboratories, industry, and governments that increase the likelihood that a virus modified in a research project might accidentally be released. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These issues also form the basis of more detailed evaluations that fall under the rubric of “rhetorical analysis”—another approach that looks at the form and format of the argument, as well as its context and some aspects of the construction of the arguments (see one example &lt;a href=&quot;https://miamioh.edu/hcwe/handouts/rhetorical-analyses/index.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Again, the approach in this article is not to evaluate the specific examples and data, but to look at how those are used to construct the argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One part of this analysis is to examine what is called the “warrant” or the connection between the evidence presented and the conclusion. For example, in this article Wade argues that “CGG is coronavirus’s least popular codon for arginine.” There is, Wade continues, a CGG-CGG pair at a critical site that is essential for infecting human cells, even though this arrangement is unknown in related coronaviruses. The “warrant” in Wade’s argument is that rarity of the sequence in Nature implies that a purposeful insertion is a better explanation for this configuration than natural processes that produce changes in nucleotide sequences. (Readers will recognize that this sort of error—the unwarranted conclusion or inference—is the same one that we see in pseudoscientific explications of “evidences against” evolution.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The outcomes of the C.R.A.P. profile and the rhetorical analysis do not mean that source is necessarily unreliable, but it places the material in a context that allows readers to compare its features and characteristics directly with other material from other sources. In this case, it suggests that the source publication has a vested interest in a particular perspective on the issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the rhetorical analysis, when we come to this point, we advise students that it is time to look at appropriate disciplinary literature and to compare the data, methods, and conclusions that specialists in the field are applying to the problem, and then to record what questions those specialists are still asking after their own investigation. If there is significant disagreement in the field, it pops up in these comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wade looks at the evidence he has compiled and concludes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Neither the natural emergence nor the lab escape hypothesis can yet be ruled out. There is still no direct evidence for either. So no definitive conclusion can be reached.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

That said, the available evidence leans more strongly in one direction than the other. Readers will form their own opinion. But it seems to me that proponents of lab escape can explain all the available facts about [SARS-Cov-2] considerably more easily than can those who favor natural emergence. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He seems to be hedging his bets here—or pulling his punches—at what seemed like an argument strongly committed to a laboratory origin of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By comparison, the joint investigative team of the World Health Organization came to a different conclusion in its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/final-joint-report_origins-studies-6-april-201.pdf?sfvrsn=4f5e5196_1&amp;amp;download=true&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; released just about a month earlier:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In summary, the joint team considered the following ranking of potential introduction pathways, from very likely to extremely unlikely: (1) through an intermediate host; (2) direct zoonotic introduction; (3) introduction through cold/ food chain; and (4) introduction resulting from a laboratory incident. Building from the evidence for the studies conducted so far, follow-up research studies were proposed for the first three options (p. 112)....&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, after a review of existing evidence, the WHO report concluded:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In view of the above, a laboratory origin of the pandemic was considered to be extremely unlikely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

What would be needed to increase knowledge?&lt;br /&gt;

Regular administrative and internal review of high-level biosafety laboratories worldwide. Follow-up of new evidence supplied around possible laboratory leaks (p. 120). &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, an account by a virologist specializing in coronaviruses would be the gold standard, if it were as accessible as this article written by a science journalist who knows how to communicate effectively with ordinary people. The main question that people ask is,”How can we tell if a virus has been modified in a lab versus a natural process in the wild, and what evidence do we still need to reach a conclusion?” And that is the crux of the argument. If we could make that clear to the average reader, one hopes it would replace big conspiracy theories with reasoned discussion that could resolve the question.&lt;/p&gt;

Mr. Phelps has dredged up the old version of the statement of faith from the Wayback Machine and compared it with the new. You may read Mr. Phelps’s article for yourself, but in a nutshell, he notes that the new version argues that

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; No fact may be considered valid if it contradicts the &quot;scriptural record.&quot; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The only valid marriage is that between a naturally born [sic] man and a naturally born woman.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Social justice, intersectionality, and critical race theory are anti-Biblical. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Gender and sex are the same thing, and attempts to change your &quot;sex (gender)&quot; are sinful. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Death, suffering, and &quot;natural evils&quot; such as hurricanes and earthquakes are a direct consequence of sin. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this matters, in part, because Answers in Genesis operates the Ark Park in Williamstown, Kentucky.

  &lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2021/Pure_Quartz.jpg&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;By Eva K., from Wikimedia Commons.  Something Granville Sewell may not expect.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Granville Sewell is at it again, and he never seems to learn.  In &lt;a href=&quot;https://evolutionnews.org/2021/04/some-problems-can-be-proved-unsolvable/&quot;&gt;a piece at the Discovery Institute’s site Evolution News &amp;amp; Science Today&lt;/a&gt; 
he argues that it is obvious that one can reject the ordinary processes of physics, chemistry, and evolution as having brought about living organisms. His piece is entitled “Some problems can be proved unsolvable”.
He mentions a mathematical theorem that was finally proven after hundreds of years (Fermat’s Last Theorem), and a task that can easily shown to be unsolvable
(covering with two-square-sized dominos a chessboard that has had two squares in opposite corners removed).  Then he argues that it is obvious that evolving present-day
life that ends up inventing iPhones can easily be seen to be impossible by natural processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
He summarizes his argument in a few sentences:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Well, I have a very simple proof that the biological problem #3 posed above is also impossible to solve, that does fit in the margin of this document. All one needs 
to do is realize that if a solution were found, we would have proved something obviously false, that a few (four, apparently) fundamental, unintelligent 
forces of physics alone could have rearranged the fundamental particles of physics into libraries full of science texts and encyclopedias, 
computers connected to monitors, keyboards, laser printers and the Internet, cars, trucks, airplanes, nuclear power plants and Apple iPhones. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Is this really a valid proof? It seems perfectly valid to me, as I cannot think of anything in all of science that can be stated with more 
confidence than that a few unintelligent forces of physics alone could not have rearranged the basic particles of physics into Apple iPhones.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Now Sewell is a mathematician, author of a book on solving differential equations.  But he seems to accept proof-by-obviousness, a method most mathematicians
would not accept.  He should listen to them.  Instead he lays the obviousness on a bit too thick ...

&lt;!--more--&gt;

He asks whether elementary particles and the four fundamental forces of physics (there are now only two, actually) could end up with computers, iPhones, libraries,
and so on.  That sounds impossible.  But he's left out a few steps.  For example:
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Elementary particles aggregating to form larger particles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Those particles forming atoms&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Atoms becoming connected by bonds to form chemicals&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Chemicals interacting to form cosmic dust&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Cosmic dust forming clouds by the attraction of gravity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Gravity in dust clouds leading to clumps that become a solar system&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
See, it isn't just a direct aggregation of particles.  If we don't know all the details of those steps, few seem to think that the processes of astronomy, 
chemistry, and geology can't explain our planet without the intervention of a cosmic Designer.  Intelligent Design arguments are not very visible in physics, in chemistry, in astronomy, 
and in geology.  Those very active sciences get along fine without ID.  Sewell's proof-by-obviousness needs somewhat more focus.

Granville Sewell is at it again, and he never seems to learn. In a piece at the Discovery Institute’s site Evolution News &amp;amp; Science Today he argues that it is obvious that one can reject the ordinary processes of physics, chemistry, and evolution as having brought about living organisms. His piece is entitled “Some problems can be proved unsolvable”. He mentions a mathematical theorem that was finally proven after hundreds of years (Fermat’s Last Theorem), and a task that can easily shown to be unsolvable (covering with two-square-sized dominos a chessboard that has had two squares in opposite corners removed). Then he argues that it is obvious that evolving present-day life that ends up inventing iPhones can easily be seen to be impossible by natural processes. He summarizes his argument in a few sentences: Well, I have a very simple proof that the biological problem #3 posed above is also impossible to solve, that does fit in the margin of this document. All one needs to do is realize that if a solution were found, we would have proved something obviously false, that a few (four, apparently) fundamental, unintelligent forces of physics alone could have rearranged the fundamental particles of physics into libraries full of science texts and encyclopedias, computers connected to monitors, keyboards, laser printers and the Internet, cars, trucks, airplanes, nuclear power plants and Apple iPhones. Is this really a valid proof? It seems perfectly valid to me, as I cannot think of anything in all of science that can be stated with more confidence than that a few unintelligent forces of physics alone could not have rearranged the basic particles of physics into Apple iPhones. Now Sewell is a mathematician, author of a book on solving differential equations. But he seems to accept proof-by-obviousness, a method most mathematicians would not accept. He should listen to them. Instead he lays the obviousness on a bit too thick ...</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Crepuscular rays</title><link href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2021/04/crepuscular-rays.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Crepuscular rays" /><published>2021-04-26T11:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2021-04-26T11:00:00-07:00</updated><id>https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2021/04/crepuscular-rays</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2021/04/crepuscular-rays.html">&lt;p&gt;Photograph by &lt;strong&gt;Sarah Wise&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

We chose this splendid picture from among several equally splendid shots in part because it shows clearly the origin of crepuscular rays – just look at the mountain peaks and valleys, especially on the right. The rays are the result of light scattering by the atmosphere. On the left, you can clearly see atmospheric scattering where one of the rays roughly bisects a cloud. And finally, you can see how every cloud has a silver lining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Darrel Falk, a past president of BioLogos, recently reviewed Stephen Meyer’s latest book, &lt;i&gt;Return of the God Hypothesis&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://biologos.org/articles/return-of-the-god-hypothesis-a-biologists-reflections&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Professor Falk is sympathetic with Dr. Meyer and indeed avers that their “perspective[s] on the role of God in creation” are not “much different.” The review is nevertheless negative and led to an interesting exchange on a Google Group devoted in part to The Panda’s Thumb. I should stress that as far as I know none of us on PT has read the book, but by now we have probably all read the review. At any rate, the exchange is reprinted, with permission, below the fold:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul Braterman, an honorary chemistry researcher at the University of Glasgow, noticed the following quotation that Prof. Falk singled out in his review:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;To make their case for the adequacy of a strictly materialistic approach to explanation in science and philosophy, defenders of this approach must first show that “gaps” in our knowledge of the materialistic causes of key events in the history of life and the universe can be filled with knowledge of an actual materialistic process capable of producing the events in question. (p. 613).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He inquired,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I am not sure what a non-materialistic process would look like, but here Meyer appears to be claiming the right to invoke God of the gaps as the default explanation, placing the onus on the scientific community to prove that no gaps exist. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Am I being unfair?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andrew Petto, Distinguished Lecturer in BioSciences at the University of Wisconsin – Milwaukee, responded,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In essence, yes. This is the venerable creationist tactic that claims that if we do not (yet) have an explanation of some event or phenomenon based on naturalistic (so-called &quot;materialistic&quot;) processes, then, by default, the divine intervention &lt;i&gt;has&lt;/i&gt; to be accepted as the only alternative (though ID advocates tried to muddy their embrace of the Deity, they use the same logic). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

This fallacy of dualistic thinking has strong cultural resonance, especially in the USA, where we tout the value of hearing from &quot;both sides&quot; of a controversy (as though there were only two), and it was reinforced, I think, by the fact that lawyers were among some of the more prominent voices in the movement that emerged through the 1960s. For lawyers, of course, the adversarial environment in court works almost always this way: if I can poke enough holes in your argument and conclusions, then my argument and conclusions prevail. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

And this, I think, is why so much of the creationist (and now ID) literature is about problems with or &quot;evidences&quot; against evolution without any significant demonstration that the cre/ID position has any factual or experimental support. In their minds (and in the dualistic framework that they impose on the argument), there doesn't need to be any affirmative evidence. It is enough to show that your opponent's position is untenable or unsupported or somehow defective, and you win by default. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

It may work culturally, but it fails the chief claim made by ID and earlier &quot;creation scientists&quot;: that theirs is a scientific alternative. It is, in fact, not an alternative at all, but a vague cultural default position that is not defensible on its scientific merits&amp;mdash;or lack thereof.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><author><name>Matt Young</name></author><summary type="html">Return of the God Hypothesis: Three Scientific Discoveries that Reveal the Mind Behind the Universe, by Stephen Meyer.

&lt;p&gt;We have not discussed the bacterial flagellum on PT in a good long time – one of the last instances was Nick Matzke’s 2007 article, &lt;a href=&quot;http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2007/10/full-text-of-th.html&quot;&gt;The Edge of Creationism&lt;/a&gt;, a clever pun on Michael Behe’s book title, &lt;i&gt;The Edge of Evolution&lt;/i&gt;. In that article, Dr. Matzke thoroughly debunks Dr. Behe’s contention that the flagellum could not have evolved, hence was designed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Matzke, I am pleased to note, is at it again. He is a part of an international team led by Matthew Baker to, in their words, discover “How life got moving: reconstructing and re-evolving the bacterial flagellar motor, piece-by-piece.” Their intention, according to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://newsroom.unsw.edu.au/news/general/unsw-researcher-awarded-18m-international-life-science-grant&quot;&gt; press release from the University of New South Wales&lt;/a&gt;, is “to estimate what an ancient flagellar motor – the tiny rotating wheel that powers the swimming movement of bacteria – might have looked like, and then re-engineer it for further experimentation and research.” So much for not evolving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In what must be an improbable case of convergent evolution, a team headed by Morgan Beeby at Imperial College London has been awarded a grant for a project titled “Darwin rwinDa: rewinding and rerunning evolution to study innovation in action” (no, that is not a typo). According to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/219213/team-investigating-evolution-bacterial-tails-wins/&quot;&gt;press release from Imperial College&lt;/a&gt;, their intention is to discover “How can gradual, Darwinian evolution build such a structure if not by inventing all necessary parts at once?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Phelps explains,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Gastroliths are usually defined as stones that were swallowed by herbivorous dinosaurs, or other animals, to aid in digesting food. Many types of vegetarian dinosaurs did not have grinding teeth and thus swallowed their food without chewing. This process is analogous to the tiny stones swallowed by some modern birds that are kept in a gizzard to aid in the digestion of food. Other animals, such as the marine reptiles known as plesiosaurs, swallowed stones for a different reason, namely to create ballast and thus be able to dive deeper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Usually, gastroliths are highly polished stones made of very fine-grained chert, like this specimen. Sometimes they are also made of petrified wood and even, on occasion, igneous and metamorphic rocks. Unless a gastrolith is found within an articulated dinosaur skeleton, there is always a bit of justified skepticism about any well-polished rock identified as one. There is a  possibility that this is only a rather well-polished extraformational pebble that was somehow deposited in fine-grained sediment in the Morrison/Cloverly, but this possibility doesn’t effect the point I will make below. The possible gastrolith illustrated is made out of chert and contains fossils of crinoids and other organisms. In any case, these rocks were already lithified before being deposited in younger rock formations. They contain fossils of life that existed before the Jurassic and in many cases before the Mesozoic. This is true of such pebbles whether they are true gastroliths or merely well-rounded, polished pebbles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Most Young Earth Creationists (YEC's), such as those who built the Ark Park, claim gastroliths formed in one year during Noah’s Flood (usually claimed to have occurred in 2348 BCE). The sequence, precursors of the gastroliths formed from ancient sediment, &lt;i&gt;then&lt;/i&gt; lithified, &lt;i&gt;then&lt;/i&gt; re-eroded, &lt;i&gt;then&lt;/i&gt; partly rounded, &lt;i&gt;then&lt;/i&gt; swallowed by herbivorous dinosaurs, &lt;i&gt;then&lt;/i&gt; further polished in the dinosaur’s digestive system, is totally inconsistent with YEC claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

I thought of this long ago, and just discovered this &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/8QATIUy6r6s&quot;&gt;well-done YouTube video by Erika Gutsick Gibbon&lt;/a&gt; (possibly a pseudonym) explaining why gastroliths are inconsistent with YEC.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><author><name>Matt Young</name></author><summary type="html">Photographs by Dan Phelps.
