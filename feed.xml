Ms. Reid notes that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;even though the overwhelming likelihood remains that SARS-CoV-2 evolved naturally, the accidental-escape theory hasn’t been ruled out. Still, there are a lot of reasons why that scenario is unlikely. Foremost among them, to my mind, is that it’s hard to imagine how a wild bat virus could evolve the ability to be both infectious to humans and transmissible between humans in a highly controlled laboratory environment, even admitting the possibility of occasional safety lapses (which have so far only been rumored, not proven). Remember, the most closely related bat virus — which cannot infect humans — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-020-0771-4&quot;&gt;differs at over 1,200 nucleotides&lt;/a&gt;. Nevertheless, making a good-faith effort to rule out that possibility is important, and that is why a group of prominent scientists recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/372/6543/694.1&quot;&gt;called for a new investigation&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting that an earlier one was not as thorough as it should have been.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Reid gives short shrift to the “theory” that the virus was released deliberately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The controversy may have begun in earnest on May 5, when the science journalist &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Wade&quot;&gt;Nicholas Wade&lt;/a&gt; in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists asked, &lt;a href=&quot;https://thebulletin.org/2021/05/the-origin-of-covid-did-people-or-nature-open-pandoras-box-at-wuhan/&quot;&gt;Did people or nature open Pandora’s box at Wuhan?&lt;/a&gt; Mr. Wade is a former reporter for Science and the New York Times, and holds a bachelor of arts degree in natural sciences. He has written an interesting article, but in the end he blames “Trump Derangement Syndrome” (my characterization, not his) for scientists’ unwillingness to consider the lab-leak hypothesis. Whatever the merits of his article, he begins his conclusion with these loaded sentences:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; If the case that SARS2 originated in a lab is so substantial, why isn’t this more widely known? As may now be obvious, there are many people who have reason not to talk about it. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conspiracy “theory” continues, blaming scientists, for example, for failure to rock the boat and risk their funding. Mr. Wade’s article finally concludes,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; The common sense perception that a pandemic breaking out in Wuhan might have something to do with a Wuhan lab cooking up novel viruses of maximal danger in unsafe conditions could eventually displace the ideological insistence that whatever Trump said can’t be true. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, apparently on the strength of Mr. Wade’s article, the Bulletin plans a &lt;a href=&quot;https://thebulletin.org/events/&quot;&gt; virtual program &lt;/a&gt; to discuss Mr. Wade’s “groundbreaking article,” featuring Mr. Wade himself, Bulletin editor-in-chief John Mecklin, and Bulletin president and CEO Rachel Bronson. And not an epidemiologist or virologist in sight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On May 14, David Relman of Stanford and 17 colleagues published a &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/372/6543/694.1&quot;&gt;letter to the editor&lt;/a&gt; of Science magazine; Dr. Relman and his colleagues are the “group of prominent scientists” to whom Ms. Reid refers. The authors are all biologists, epidemiologists, immunologists, and so on. They say, primarily, that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/WHA73/A73_R1-en.pdf&quot;&gt;report by the World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; did not give sufficient consideration to the possibility of an accident or a leak from the virology laboratory and should not have concluded so firmly that “a zoonotic spillover from an intermediate host as ‘likely to very likely,’ and a laboratory incident as ‘extremely unlikely.’”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not mean to cherry-pick, but, as if to emphasize the political rather than the scientific, an article in Nature on May 27, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01383-3&quot;&gt;Divisive COVID ‘lab leak’ debate prompts dire warnings from researchers&lt;/a&gt;, quoted Angela Rasmussen of the University of Saskatchewan as criticizing Dr. Relman and his colleagues for not considering “how [their article] would feed into the divisive political environment surrounding this issue.” Dr. Rasmussen added, “This debate has moved so far from the evidence that I don’t know if we can dial it back.” Indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As my head began to spin and my eyes lost their ability to focus on my monitor, I read a June 2 Washington Post &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/coronavirus-bats-china-wuhan/2021/06/02/772ef984-beb2-11eb-922a-c40c9774bc48_story.html&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; which, though largely a profile of a Chinese researcher, mentioned a very curious hypothesis:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The report lent credence to China’s preferred theory that the virus could have come from overseas, possibly via frozen food imports — though Beijing has presented little support for that. On the question of a possible lab leak, the report concluded that pathway was “extremely unlikely.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not quite a conspiracy theory, but &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of conspiracies, I read a May 31 post, &lt;a href=&quot;https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/the-origin-of-sars-cov-2-revisited/&quot;&gt;The origin of SARS-CoV-2, revisited&lt;/a&gt;, by the well known skeptic and medical doctor David Gorski. Dr. Gorski reminds us,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[W]henever there is a major outbreak, epidemic, or pandemic of infectious disease, one conspiracy theory always—and I do mean always—arises. That conspiracy theory is that the causative microbe was developed in a laboratory and/or escaped a laboratory. HIV, H1N1, the original SARS, Ebola virus, every single one of them gave birth to such conspiracy theories. Unsurprisingly, given its global scope and death toll, so it was with SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Gorski article is long, and I cannot go into detail. He points out something, however, that ought to be obvious but apparently is not: &lt;i&gt;The fact that there are two hypotheses does not mean that they are equally probable.&lt;/i&gt; Thus, he concludes,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The natural origin hypothesis tends to [be] the default for any new disease that arises for the simple reason that it is by far the most likely to be the correct explanation. It’s very common for viruses to mutate and evolve in animals and then jump over to humans and pandemics have been caused this way before. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biologist Jerry Coyne also weighed in on June 4, in a blog post entitled &lt;a href=&quot;https://whyevolutionistrue.com/2021/06/04/did-the-covid-19-virus-come-from-a-wuhan-lab-its-looking-increasingly-likely/&quot;&gt;Did the Covid-19 virus come from a Wuhan lab? It’s looking increasingly likely&lt;/a&gt;. By “it,” Dr. Coyne means an accidental release. He refers here to a Newsweek article, which I have not read; he writes,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It was a group of amateurs, following the lead of an (sic) young Indian called “The Seeker,” who determined that the sequence of the pandemic virus was almost identical to that of the virus stored in the WIV (they managed to get the latter sequence), and that that virus was likely the one who killed the three men nine years ago. They also found out, through diligent labor, that the WIV was actually studying the virus despite their denial, and had made seven trips to the guano mine to collect samples. The amateurs found grant proposals from the WIV, which was apparently testing the infectivity of the collected viruses, possibly with the hope of producing a vaccine against them.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am mildly skeptical of something put forward by a “group of amateurs,” and I mention this blog post largely because the comments were instructive, and some of these criticized aspects of Dr. Gorski’s article. A commenter, Douglas Healy, claimed, correctly, I think, “When you mix politics with science, what you get is politics.” The conclusion to Mr. Wade’s article certainly lends support to Mr. Healy’s hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me? I am not a biologist, only a fellow traveler. I found Ms. Reid’s advice not to jump the gun to be compelling, and I thought that Dr. Gorski’s observations about the number of failed conspiracy theories were right on target. Until I unearth further evidence, I shall consider “natural source” to be the odds-on favorite.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Matt Young</name></author><summary type="html">In a dispassionate look at the Covid pandemic, on May 28, Ann Reid of the National Center for Science Education warns us not to jump the gun and assume that the pandemic was caused by a leak from the laboratory of the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV).

&lt;blockquote&gt;Appears the Biologic Institute [An enterprise of the Discovery Institute] is history, green screen and all. On their 2019 990, Director Axe will no longer draw a salary, but will be a prof at Biola “Univ.” Office space is for rent. Location is listed as “permanently closed.” Their final 990 showed a loss of $133,000. [Emendation in original.] &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I checked Guidestar for their latest IRS Form 990-EZ, which is dated 2019 and covers the fiscal year 2018 (Charity Navigator is a year behind). Sure enough, it contains the following statement on line 28:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;DR. AXE ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH BIOLA UNIVERSITY TO SERVE AS THE MAXWELL VISITING PROFESSOR OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY DURING THE 2018/2019 ACADEMIC YEAR, WITH REGULAR VISITS TO CAMPUS. IN AUGUST 2019, DR. AXE BECAME THE MAXWELL PROFESSOR OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AT BIOLA, WORKING FULL TIME ON TEACHING AND WORKING TO HELP BUILD A COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH ENVIRONMENT AT BIOLA THAT INCLUDES ADVANCED UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS. ALTHOUGH HE NO LONGER DRAWS A SALARY FROM BIOLOGIC INSTITUTE, DR. AXE CONTINUES TO SERVE AS THE DIRECTOR AND IS EXPLORING WAYS IN WHICH BIOLOGIC CAN PARTNER WITH BIOLA. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “Dr. Axe” in question is Douglas Axe, the president of the Biologic Institute. His salary of $133,333 in 2018 was the bulk of the total expenses of $201,873. Revenue was $68,600, leaving a deficit almost exactly equal to Dr. Axe’s salary. Inasmuch as Dr. Axe “no longer draws a salary from Biologic Institute,” it seems safe to say that they are effectively out of business, even though he “is exploring ways in which Biologic can partner with Biola.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not very familiar with Biologic Institute, and reading a 2019 Form 990-EZ seems almost like reading ancient history, or at least medieval history, so I took a look at their website. The home page displays an undated article that was reposted from a 2017 article, followed by another article dated 2018. Medieval history indeed! Undiscouraged, I checked a tab labeled &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biologicinstitute.org/research&quot;&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt;. After a long discussion of motivation, “core ideas,” and research areas, they list their publications. I will let other people discuss the content of the publications and will note only that the most recent is from 2014. Thus, unless the web page has simply been ignored, there has been little or no activity at the Biologic Institute since 2013 or 2014 at the latest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the Biologic Institute is not dead, it has surely been moribund for the better part of the last decade. Where, I wonder, is their vaunted research program now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ADDED 6:30 p.m., 05/23/2021:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A colleague sent me &lt;a href=&quot;https://ccfs.sos.wa.gov/#/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, whence I scrolled down to “Charity … Search” and entered “Biologic Institute.” I quickly found the following, which suggests that they ceased operations on 09/30/2019 with a balance of $9285, which precisely matches the amount on the last Form 990_EZ that I could find.&lt;/p&gt;

Clarke, &lt;i&gt;James Hall of Albany, Geologist and Palaeontologist&lt;/i&gt; (1921). Public domain.&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The evil that men do lives after them;&lt;br /&gt;
  
The good is oft interred with their bones.&lt;br /&gt;

&amp;mdash;Shakespeare, &lt;i&gt;Julius Caesar&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ask Thomas Henry Huxley if you do not believe Marc Antony. According to an article in AS Review, &lt;a href=&quot;https://asreview.org/2021/01/22/thomas-huxley-once-respected-now-rejected/&quot;&gt;Thomas Huxley: Once Respected, Now Rejected&lt;/a&gt;, a big brouhaha has erupted over the name of the Huxley College of the Environment at Western Washington University. The issue is important, because if people succeed in “canceling” Huxley, possibly Darwin will be next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huxley’s “sin” is to have held many of the same views regarding race as most of his contemporaries. More specifically, &lt;a href=&quot;https://president.wwu.edu/files/2021-04/Rupke%20Huxley%20Legacy.pdf&quot;&gt;according to the historian Nicolaas Rupke&lt;/a&gt;, Huxley&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;formulated what became known as ‘Huxley’s Law’ or ‘Huxley’s Rule,’ which stated that the distance in biological, evolutionary development between the highest and lowest humans is greater than the distance between the lowest humans and the highest apes (chimpanzee, gorilla), thus degrading native peoples across the British Empire.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;True, as nearly as I can determine, but the term Huxley’s Law is not in common use and appears to have been coined by Prof. Rupke himself, &lt;a href=&quot;https://president.wwu.edu/files/2021-04/Rupke%20-%20Huxley%27s%20Rule.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed, the distinguished philosopher of biology, David Hull, has noted in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jstor.org/stable/3827456&quot;&gt;book review&lt;/a&gt; that “nothing today goes by the name of Huxley’s Law.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The president’s office at Western Washington University has &lt;a href=&quot;https://president.wwu.edu/research-and-resources&quot;&gt;appointed a task force and solicited comments&lt;/a&gt; regarding renaming the College. They asked three questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; What role did Huxley’s beliefs on race occupy in his intellectual works, his public statements, and his life as a whole? Were they remarkable in the context of the time and place in which he lived? 

&lt;br /&gt;Did Huxley’s scientific work contribute, either in support or opposition, to the development of scientific racism and Social Darwinism, both during his lifetime and after? What portion of his total work did these contributions occupy, and how significant are those contributions in supporting or refuting the ideology of scientific racism?

&lt;br /&gt;What harmful institutional practices, policies, or general practical consequences, if any, can be specifically traced to Huxley’s views? &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consistently with the quotation from Shakespeare, above, they did not ask a single question about Huxley’s many accomplishments, which, I take it, are to be interred with his bones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read the submissions by Prof. Rupke, who is a professor of history at Washington and Lee University; &lt;a href=&quot;https://president.wwu.edu/files/2021-04/PS%20White%20Huxley%20Legacy.pdf&quot;&gt;Paul White&lt;/a&gt; of the Darwin Correspondence Project of the University of Cambridge; &lt;a href=&quot;https://president.wwu.edu/files/2021-04/Lyons%20Huxley%20Legacy.pdf&quot;&gt;Sherrie Lyons&lt;/a&gt; of Empire State College; &lt;a href=&quot;https://president.wwu.edu/files/2021-04/Reidy%20Huxley%20Legacy.pdf&quot;&gt;Michael Reidy&lt;/a&gt;, Professor of History, Montana State University; and an article in the Seattle Times, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.seattletimes.com/opinion/reconsider-cancel-culture-target-at-wwu/&quot;&gt;Reconsider cancel-culture target at WWU&lt;/a&gt;, by Steve Hollenhorst and Wayne Landis, both professors and administrators at Huxley.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The submissions that I read, save that of Prof. Rupke and the AS Review article, seem to me to be generally favorable toward Huxley. If you want to read one piece, read the article by Hollenhorst and Landis. I think they get it about right: Huxley’s main crime was living in the 1800’s and sharing many of the attitudes of his contemporaries. But in fact he was well ahead of his contemporaries in being an abolitionist in a country that largely supported the Confederacy during the American Civil War. Sure, he thought that the British aristocracy was in some way superior to the “primitive” peoples in Africa or Australia; who in 1880 did not? Let us be careful to avoid the fallacy of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentism_(literary_and_historical_analysis)&quot;&gt;presentism&lt;/a&gt;. Despite his bias, Huxley opposed slavery and fought against social Darwinism on moral grounds. Even Lincoln, I should add parenthetically, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/1862/08/24/archives/a-letter-from-president-lincoln-reply-to-horace-greeley-slavery-and.html&quot;&gt;wrote in the New York Times&lt;/a&gt;, “If I could save the Union without freeing any slave, I would do it….”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might have been catty of them, but Profs. Hollenhorst and Landis opened their article with the observation that their university, Western Washington University, is named indirectly after a slave owner: George Washington. If I wanted to be catty myself, I would add that Prof. Rupke’s university, Washington and Lee University, is named after both Washington and the famous defender of slavery, Robert E. Lee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cattiness aside, I would like to let Profs. Hollenhorst and Landis get the last word:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The distinguished historians WWU asked to look at the issue overwhelmingly concluded the claims just don’t hold up. Huxley’s early writings did reflect the prevailing bigotry and prejudice of Victorian society, although even then to a lesser degree than his scientific peers. By the 1860s, he became a vocal abolitionist and by the end of his life called for universal equal rights regardless of race or gender. The beautiful irony of his scientific work on human diversity is [that] it ultimately leads him to see the oneness, and equality, of all humanity. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, further,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Huxley later expanded these ideas in his great battles against social Darwinism and religion, which he saw as grounded in the dark forces of authority, bigotry and superstition. He feared they led to social order based on competition, subjugation and inequality. In this he was prescient, for indeed both have been used to justify not only laissez-faire capitalism and political conservatism, but also colonialism, eugenics, racism and eventually fascism. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It’s telling he didn’t teach at Cambridge or Oxford, but rather working-class institutions, the Royal School of Mines and later Imperial College, where he brought science and industry together to solve societal problems. He gave hundreds of free public lectures to common folk. As an early advocate for public education, he was elected to the London School Board, where he worked to bring a decent education to ordinary people and implemented the first training for science teachers. In other words, he’d make an exemplary WWU faculty member today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

What would Huxley say about his legacy? First, he’d commend us for interrogating it, especially the brave students, who without power and risking reproach, stood up to raise the issue. But he’d then remind them that “it is not what we believe, but why we believe it. Moral responsibility lies in diligently weighing the evidence.” And to all of us he’d likely say, “learn what is true in order to do what is right.” Now that the question is before us, address it with honesty and integrity. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, finally,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Don’t be fooled. Huxley’s message isn’t privileged. It isn’t elitist. It isn’t racist. It’s timeless. The values he fought for are at the core of public higher education to this day. Far from causing harm, we are in a better place because of Thomas H. Huxley. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I shall add, finally, and not entirely parenthetically, that Profs. Hollenhorst and Landis trace the association between Huxley and social Darwinism to a notorious fabricator, Henry Morris, the founder of “scientific” creationism and himself something of a racist. It is partly because of this background that I fear that if Huxley is “cancelled,” then Darwin is next.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Matt Young</name></author><summary type="html">Autograph portrait of Professor Huxley before he &quot;returned to the use of his razor.&quot; From a notebook used by him about 1857 and evidently made to amuse his baby.

The issue is important, because if people succeed in “canceling” Huxley, possibly Darwin will be next. Huxley’s “sin” is to have held many of the same views regarding race as most of his contemporaries. More specifically, according to the historian Nicolaas Rupke, Huxley formulated what became known as ‘Huxley’s Law’ or ‘Huxley’s Rule,’ which stated that the distance in biological, evolutionary development between the highest and lowest humans is greater than the distance between the lowest humans and the highest apes (chimpanzee, gorilla), thus degrading native peoples across the British Empire. True, as nearly as I can determine, but the term Huxley’s Law is not in common use and appears to have been coined by Prof. Rupke himself, here. Indeed, the distinguished philosopher of biology, David Hull, has noted in a book review that “nothing today goes by the name of Huxley’s Law.”</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">We are the knights who say … evolution</title><link href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2021/05/We-are-the-knights-who-say-evolution.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="We are the knights who say … evolution" /><published>2021-05-15T06:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2021-05-15T06:00:00-07:00</updated><id>https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2021/05/We-are-the-knights-who-say-evolution</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2021/05/We-are-the-knights-who-say-evolution.html">&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Bad “Evolutionary” Habit&lt;/h3&gt;

Throughout these articles, one can see the writers inserting the adjective “evolutionary” in front of everything. 
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; “an evolutionary geneticist at the University of Copenhagen” — why not just a geneticist?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; “giraffes are a poster child for evolutionary oddities” — why not just oddities?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; “several phenotypic traits that share evolutionary constraints” — why not just constraints, as in engineering specifications?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; “This [reduction in olfactory sensitivity] may be an evolutionary consequence of enhanced vision” — why not just a consequence, as in a designed trade-off for multiple competing specifications?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; “evolutionary adaptations” — why not just adaptations, or unique traits fit for the giraffe’s ecological niche?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; “evolutionary pleiotropy” — why not just pleiotropy?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; “a suite of traits are changed within a short evolutionary time” — why not a suite of traits that work together?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Typists could avoid carpal tunnel syndrome by eliminating this unnecessary word in science papers and news stories. 
It seems that the “evolutionary” biologists, who should just call themselves biologists, want to push a narrative
that everything in the living world must pay tribute to Darwin. The repetition of the word hammers it into people’s
heads. Everything in nature, they are taught with this propaganda tactic, is part of a fluid phantasmagoric 
tableau where every creature came from some other creature and is becoming something else. 
&lt;p&gt;

&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;(end of quote from EN&amp;amp;ST)&lt;/em&gt;

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
&lt;p&gt;
And here I had thought that the Discovery Institute was now OK with using the word &quot;evolution&quot;.  After all, they
have often explained, everything changes, and that is all that &quot;evolution&quot; means.  It is only when natural selection is invoked that
they become unable to acknowledge those changes.  And, it turns out, when common descent is inferred.  Their love affair with &quot;change&quot;
seems to always end there.
&lt;p&gt;
So now we seem to be back to an earlier era, when species were assumed to be fixed.  Even Young Earth Creationists seemed lately 
to have invoked extremely rapid evolution so as to turn the limited number of &quot;kinds&quot; that would fit on the Ark into all present-day species in a few hundred years.
But now the Discovery Institute announces that, whatever the amount of change, the word &quot;evolution&quot; is unhearable.
&lt;p&gt;
Well, I am an evolutionary biologist, because that's what I work on -- the processes of evolution and the history of life that results. 
And I guarantee you that evolutionary geneticists, evolutionary genomicists, evolutionary anthropologists, evolutionary physiologists, evolutionary developmental biologists,
and evolutionary molecular biologists are going to keep using that word, no matter how unhearable it is to the Discovery Institute. We will investigate
evolutionary rates, evolutionary correlations, evolutionary tradeoffs, and much more.
And there is no &quot;shrubbery&quot; that will change that.

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A high-school English teacher once told our class that “higher education is a process of learning more and more about less and less.” Catchy and memorable, but only true to the extent that most of our careers—academic and otherwise—tend to make us “experts” on a limited number of topics. So it is inevitable that we will confront some information that is outside our expertise, and we will need to make judgments about arguments, actions, or policies based on this information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, journalist Nicholas Wade authored a &lt;a href=&quot;https://thebulletin.org/2021/05/the-origin-of-covid-did-people-or-nature-open-pandoras-box-at-wuhan/&quot;&gt; piece in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists&lt;/a&gt; about the origin of SARS-CoV-2—the coronavirus that is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic—giving credence to the claim that the virus was leaked from a laboratory in Wuhan (China) instead of emerging from a natural reservoir such as local bat populations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those who have expertise in the details of laboratory research with viruses can certainly evaluate and critique the claims that Wade presented in support of his argument. But what about the rest of us? How do we evaluate arguments with important consequences without resorting to “dueling experts” who claim equal authority and come down on opposite sides?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a challenge for all of us who deal with claims and evidence outside our own expertise and experience. Even if we don’t know an exon from Exxon, we need a way to evaluate how much credibility to give particular arguments, such as this piece from Nicholas Wade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we teach the basics of reading research literature to students, we expect that, at first, they lack the specific disciplinary expertise necessary to critique the content effectively. So we help them to develop an approach that looks for clues in the source, the format and presentation, the language and appeal, the purpose, and other characteristics of the argument that we can identify without having a deep grasp of the technical details of a specific field of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A simplified &lt;a href=&quot;https://writingcenter.tamu.edu/Students/Writing-Speaking-Guides/Alphabetical-List-of-Guides/Citing-Documenting/Evaluating-Scholarly-Sources&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt; provided by the Writing Center at Texas A&amp;amp;M University uses the C.R.A.P. acronym to help students focus on revealing indicators of credibility of persuasion pieces such as the one on the source of the COVID-19 pandemic. These are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
•	Currency: Is the information up to date; has it been supplanted or refuted by newer resources?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
•	Reliability: Is the information reviewed or vetted by people with specific expertise in a relevant field? Does it represent the consensus of that field, a commonly acknowledged alternative to the consensus, or a position rarely accepted by those most knowledgeable?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
•	Authority: Is there a specific author whose qualifications to identify and evaluate relevant evidence and to place it in context can be verified? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
•	Purpose: Does the author or publication have a particular goal or mission to explore issues in a certain way or from a certain perspective, and is it intended more to persuade or to inform? Most of this information is readily available from the source, whether it is a periodical or a web site. We teach students that sources that do not provide this information are automatically suspect. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember: This is not an approach that attempts to evaluate the technical details of the argument, but one that looks at the context in which the argument is made and the way that it is presented and supported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currency: Wade’s article is recent, but the information used in it goes back up to a decade, and it is not clear whether issues raised and inferences and conclusions reached and reported early in the pandemic are still current. Have they been re-evaluated, modified, or even retracted in the light of newer information?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reliability: The publication’s policy for vetting or reviewing technical information is not clear. It does not classify this article as to content and intent. Is it news? Investigative reporting? Opinion? The article seems intent on persuading us of a position, rather than merely informing us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Authority: The author, Nicholas Wade, has a good record as an “explainer” of things scientific. He worked for years at the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; and has some good collections of articles that are useful for high-school and introductory-college level readers and that give a good overview of established science. His credentials as a science journalist are well established, but Wade is not a virologist or a microbiologist or an epidemiologist. He is a journalist, albeit one with a specialty in scientific—particularly biologic—topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result is that Wade has to rely on published reports and interviews of scientists in the relevant fields. This is not a bad thing—one should get one’s information from these sources—but it is difficult to evaluate Twitter feeds, interviews, and other media except via an appeal to the authority of those who are quoted in these sources (see reliability above).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Purpose: In this case the mission statement of the &lt;i&gt;Bulletin of Atomic Scientists&lt;/i&gt; tells us that its focus is on threats to existence caused by humans. So its articles are going to emphasize things that humans do that threaten human life on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://thebulletin.org/about-us/&quot;&gt;Our Mission&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
The Bulletin equips the public, policymakers, and scientists with the information needed to reduce man-made threats to our existence.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the themes of the publication is to highlight threats posed by technologies that we do not or cannot control properly; a major theme of this article is the potential for accidental release of laboratory-engineered viruses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;About Us&lt;br /&gt;
At our core, the Bulletin is a media organization, publishing a free-access website and a bimonthly magazine. But we are much more. The Bulletin’s website, iconic Doomsday Clock, and regular events help advance actionable ideas at a time when technology is outpacing our ability to control it. The Bulletin focuses on three main areas: nuclear risk, climate change, and disruptive technologies. What connects these topics is a driving belief that because humans created them, we can control them. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the very least, this is a publication that is going to be more sympathetic to explanations about “threats” that are caused by humans (intentional or otherwise). In this case, part of the argument is that laboratory technologies used in the study of viruses are endangering humanity and the world, at least in part because of shortcuts taken by researchers, research laboratories, industry, and governments that increase the likelihood that a virus modified in a research project might accidentally be released. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These issues also form the basis of more detailed evaluations that fall under the rubric of “rhetorical analysis”—another approach that looks at the form and format of the argument, as well as its context and some aspects of the construction of the arguments (see one example &lt;a href=&quot;https://miamioh.edu/hcwe/handouts/rhetorical-analyses/index.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Again, the approach in this article is not to evaluate the specific examples and data, but to look at how those are used to construct the argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One part of this analysis is to examine what is called the “warrant” or the connection between the evidence presented and the conclusion. For example, in this article Wade argues that “CGG is coronavirus’s least popular codon for arginine.” There is, Wade continues, a CGG-CGG pair at a critical site that is essential for infecting human cells, even though this arrangement is unknown in related coronaviruses. The “warrant” in Wade’s argument is that rarity of the sequence in Nature implies that a purposeful insertion is a better explanation for this configuration than natural processes that produce changes in nucleotide sequences. (Readers will recognize that this sort of error—the unwarranted conclusion or inference—is the same one that we see in pseudoscientific explications of “evidences against” evolution.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The outcomes of the C.R.A.P. profile and the rhetorical analysis do not mean that source is necessarily unreliable, but it places the material in a context that allows readers to compare its features and characteristics directly with other material from other sources. In this case, it suggests that the source publication has a vested interest in a particular perspective on the issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the rhetorical analysis, when we come to this point, we advise students that it is time to look at appropriate disciplinary literature and to compare the data, methods, and conclusions that specialists in the field are applying to the problem, and then to record what questions those specialists are still asking after their own investigation. If there is significant disagreement in the field, it pops up in these comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wade looks at the evidence he has compiled and concludes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Neither the natural emergence nor the lab escape hypothesis can yet be ruled out. There is still no direct evidence for either. So no definitive conclusion can be reached.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

That said, the available evidence leans more strongly in one direction than the other. Readers will form their own opinion. But it seems to me that proponents of lab escape can explain all the available facts about [SARS-Cov-2] considerably more easily than can those who favor natural emergence. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He seems to be hedging his bets here—or pulling his punches—at what seemed like an argument strongly committed to a laboratory origin of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By comparison, the joint investigative team of the World Health Organization came to a different conclusion in its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/final-joint-report_origins-studies-6-april-201.pdf?sfvrsn=4f5e5196_1&amp;amp;download=true&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; released just about a month earlier:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In summary, the joint team considered the following ranking of potential introduction pathways, from very likely to extremely unlikely: (1) through an intermediate host; (2) direct zoonotic introduction; (3) introduction through cold/ food chain; and (4) introduction resulting from a laboratory incident. Building from the evidence for the studies conducted so far, follow-up research studies were proposed for the first three options (p. 112)....&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, after a review of existing evidence, the WHO report concluded:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In view of the above, a laboratory origin of the pandemic was considered to be extremely unlikely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

What would be needed to increase knowledge?&lt;br /&gt;

Regular administrative and internal review of high-level biosafety laboratories worldwide. Follow-up of new evidence supplied around possible laboratory leaks (p. 120). &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, an account by a virologist specializing in coronaviruses would be the gold standard, if it were as accessible as this article written by a science journalist who knows how to communicate effectively with ordinary people. The main question that people ask is,”How can we tell if a virus has been modified in a lab versus a natural process in the wild, and what evidence do we still need to reach a conclusion?” And that is the crux of the argument. If we could make that clear to the average reader, one hopes it would replace big conspiracy theories with reasoned discussion that could resolve the question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt; No fact may be considered valid if it contradicts the &quot;scriptural record.&quot; &lt;/li&gt;
